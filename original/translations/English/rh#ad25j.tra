@0    = ~With so much going on, we haven't had much of a chance simply to talk. I'll pour you a glass of wine and we can try to forget about this madness for a short time.~
@1    = ~Forget? If only.~
@2    = ~I haven't heard a better idea this tenday.~
@3    = ~I hardly need the *wine* to forget, my dear. (smile)~
@4    = ~I don't need the wine, but I'd love to talk.~
@5    = ~I really don't have the time to talk right now.~
@6    = ~I know. It isn't particularly easy. And for you...~
@7    = ~Some elven wine, a gift from dear, sweet Ellesime. I think she could sense how much I still hated her, and hoped to reach out to estranged kindred, half-human or otherwise. Better late than never, I suppose.~
@8    = ~But I didn't want to talk about Suldanessellar to<DAYNIGHT>. Or ever, preferably.~
@9    = ~Mmm, you are far too skilled at distracting me. Perhaps I can help you *forget* later, but for now... I really did want to talk.~
@10   = ~Then dear, sweet Ellesime's wine will have to wait until another day. But I didn't want to talk about Suldanessellar to<DAYNIGHT>. Or ever, preferably.~
@11   = ~We never have the time to talk, I've noticed. That doesn't change anything. I am worried about you, <CHARNAME>.~
@12   = ~How are you holding up in the wake of everything? Irenicus, finally defeated after such a chase, your soul returned at last, and now... hells, I'm not even certain what's going on anymore.~
@13   = ~I'm just glad that Irenicus is finally dead. Whatever comes next, I needed that closure.~
@14   = ~Neither am I... it's a bit exciting in its own way, isn't it?~
@15   = ~I could almost thank Irenicus for what he did to me. I find myself savoring every emotion in a way I never would have before, and that's almost worth the pain.~
@16   = ~I thought that after Irenicus, I would finally be able to live my own life. I should have known better.~
@17   = ~Tearing a man like Irenicus from power... things will only get bigger from here.~
@18   = ~My soul's return is more a curse than a blessing. I can feel something dark growing in me, and it's terrifying.~
@19   = ~Closure, is it? It was such a godsdamned mess at the end, I'm not sure that closure is even possible.~
@20   = ~Heh. My dear, I'm sure that standing in the midst of a hurricane would be exciting in its own way.~
@21   = ~He taught you things he never intended to teach, did he? I can't say I'm surprised to hear it. I wish I could share your gratitude.~
@22   = ~I'm sure you realize that whether you're a peasant farmer or the daughter of a god, there's always going to be someone pulling the strings.~
@23   = ~The thrill of victory over a superior opponent, of taking everything he had as your own... it is somewhat exhilarating.~
@24   = ~Bhaal's essence, returned... I don't like the sound of that. Whatever you're feeling, <CHARNAME>, you have to fight it.~
@25   = ~Still, I suppose having something new to focus on is as much a blessing as a curse.~
@26   = ~At least it keeps us from spending too much time thinking about the past.~
@27   = ~Speak for yourself. I'd much prefer the chance to focus upon a cup of coffee and a good book.~
@28   = ~I'd rather concentrate on my own plans, not the schemes of every other Bhaalspawn in the Realms.~
@29   = ~I don't consider it a curse at all. The prophesy notwithstanding, we really are needed here.~
@30   = ~If the prophesy is finally coming true, I can only hope that this will all be over soon, one way or another.~
@31   = ~I suppose having something new to focus on is as much a blessing as a curse.~
@32   = ~Speak for yourself. I'd much prefer the chance to focus on a cup of coffee and a good book.~
@33   = ~If the prophesy is finally coming true, I can only hope that this will all be over soon.~
@34   = ~Theoretically, at least. In practice, though...~
@35   = ~No, there is that, I admit.~
@36   = ~Well, you had best get used to taking enemies' schemes into consideration as well.~
@37   = ~We are, are we? Someone else could fit in just as well, I think.~
@38   = ~One way or another, I expect it will be.~
@39   = ~Hmm.~
@40   = ~And what about you? I can tell when you're not happy about something, you know.~
@41   = ~You had enough at stake yourself. How does it feel to finally obtain vengeance?~
@42   = ~Enough about me. You've seemed somewhat quieter as of late.~
@43   = ~Enough about me. You've seemed somewhat angrier as of late.~
@44   = ~I can't imagine you would be asking me about Irenicus if you were not thinking about him yourself.~
@45   = ~If that's it, we really ought to be moving on now.~
@46   = ~Do I? Well, that's not overly surprising.~
@47   = ~(smile) Yes, I've noticed.~
@48   = ~Truth be told... I hardly feel anything at all. Well, nothing good, at least.~
@49   = ~I have been, I'll admit.~
@50   = ~Of course. Let's go.~
@51   = ~It's just... hard. Harder than I ever thought it would be.~
@52   = ~I'm still so angry about everything... about those blasted elves in particular, too caught up in the illusion of perfection to admit to their own mistakes.~
@53   = ~Every instinct I have just screams to lash out at something... it's a hard habit to break, especially when it's warranted.~
@54   = ~You're allowed to be angry at them, Adrian. I certainly still am.~
@55   = ~Not every instinct, apparently. You should trust yourself more.~
@56   = ~Well, I'd suggest that you don't lash out at me.~
@57   = ~Why don't you go punch Cespenar? We'd both feel better.~
@58   = ~It was never going to be easy. If it were, there would be significantly less evil in the world.~
@59   = ~You would think that with Irenicus's death, I wouldn't care anymore, but I'm still so angry about everything...~
@60   = ~About those blasted elves in particular, too caught up in the illusion of perfection to admit to their own mistakes.~
@61   = ~I honestly wish we'd let that damn tree die.~
@62   = ~I'm still angry at them as well, but you can't let it rule your life.~
@63   = ~You don't really mean that.~
@64   = ~You're angry, I know. Why don't you go punch Cespenar? We'd both feel better.~
@65   = ~I certainly would have considered it acceptable collateral damage myself.~
@66   = ~Focus on the task at hand. Once this is over, perhaps we can pay precious Suldanessellar an even less pleasant visit.~
@67   = ~Am I? I've always tended to do idiotic things when I'm angry.~
@68   = ~Trust myself... how delightfully naive of you. (sigh)~
@69   = ~I wouldn't dream of it, <CHARNAME>.~
@70   = ~Ha! A rewarding task if ever there was one. I'll have to keep that in mind.~
@71   = ~It's easier to fall than to climb back out... I'm beginning to understand that now.~
@72   = ~No... that's what Irenicus did, and look where it got him. In the end, perhaps I can't help but understand.~
@73   = ~Don't I? You might be surprised.~
@74   = ~More than acceptable, I should think.~
@75   = ~Hmm. I think I might even enjoy that.~
@76   = ~Enough of this, <CHARNAME>. I didn't mean for this conversation to take such a strange turn.~
@77   = ~I should congratulate you, <CHARNAME>. Usually there's a point at which people run out of even more powerful enemies to hunt down.~
@78   = ~With you, though, it just keeps on getting better, doesn't it?~
@79   = ~If you run out of powerful enemies, usually it's because the last one killed you.~
@80   = ~Stop laughing. It's really not that funny.~
@81   = ~Don't they say that a <PRO_MANWOMAN> is only as good as <PRO_HISHER> best enemy? I should be glad for the validation.~
@82   = ~Don't make me remind you who your old friends are.~
@83   = ~Yes, it does. I really don't want to talk about it, Adrian.~
@84   = ~You do have a point, I suppose. After all, most people never get quite this far. Failure tends to be epidemic, and at the very top...~
@85   = ~No, I suppose not. And in a way, it does make sense... after all, most people never get quite this far. Failure tends to be epidemic, and at the very top...~
@86   = ~Powerful people attract powerful opponents, do they? I suppose that's true enough, and most people never get quite this far. Failure tends to be epidemic, and at the very top...~
@87   = ~My old friends are hardly demigods, <CHARNAME>. To the best of my knowledge, at least. Granted, the highest levels of that delightful hierarchy...~
@88   = ~Blessed silence, is it? If you insist.~
@89   = ~Well, I've never been at the very top before. Intellectually, I think I understood what the stakes must look like, but to actually live it... well.~
@90   = ~That's something very different.~
@91   = ~Do you think it's actually worth it?~
@92   = ~I hope you're enjoying yourself. I most certainly am not.~
@93   = ~It's funny that with so many people seeking greatness, the ones who succeed seem to do so as if by accident.~
@94   = ~At least it isn't quite as lonely at the top as I'd been told to believe.~
@95   = ~Success comes to those who deserve it. I'm glad to be in that minority, despite the drawbacks.~
@96   = ~As much as I'd like to say "yes", I haven't really decided yet. I think it's slightly ironic, at least.~
@97   = ~I'm enjoying the irony, at least.~
@98   = ~Hilarious, I'm sure, though true in your case. I should appreciate the irony, at least.~
@99   = ~(smile) No, I suppose not. And I should appreciate the irony, at least.~
@100  = ~Perhaps not. Still, I should appreciate the irony, at least.~
@101  = ~And what the drawbacks they are. Still, I should appreciate the irony, at least.~
@102  = ~When it comes to finding a safe place to hide, at this point my chances of survival would probably be better if I ran back home. Absurd, isn't it?~
@103  = ~I'm not quite sure what to make of that.~
@104  = ~If you were looking for a place to hide, I'm afraid you went about it the wrong way entirely.~
@105  = ~Nothing is going to happen to you, Adrian.~
@106  = ~You're not considering running away now, are you?~
@107  = ~Oh, come now. It's not quite as bad as that.~
@108  = ~Suddenly frightened, are we?~
@109  = ~Heh. No, hunting archmages doesn't quite qualify as lying low. In any case, I don't mean to complain.~
@110  = ~Well, you do have a talent for predicting the future, so I suppose you may be right. Ah, no matter.~
@111  = ~Are you suddenly a diviner now, <CHARNAME>? Ah, no matter.~
@112  = ~Don't be ridiculous, <CHARNAME>.~
@113  = ~No? Well, perhaps I underestimate how dangerous the Keep is these days. In any case, I don't mean to complain.~
@114  = ~Not overly so. In any case, I certainly don't mean to complain.~
@115  = ~You know damn well I have no intention of leaving you now, the dangers notwithstanding. And I suppose I actually appreciate the front row seat to... well, whatever happens next. I know as well as anyone that when gods walk the Realms, safety is a fantasy anyway.~
@116  = ~The dangers notwithstanding, I do appreciate the front row seat to... well, whatever happens next. I know as well as anyone that when gods walk the Realms, safety is a fantasy anyway.~
@117  = ~At least we'll have some control over this madness... even if it's just the illusion of control.~
@118  = ~True enough. With the stakes this high, it's better to be involved than ignorant of the situation.~
@119  = ~Stop defining everything in terms of control, Adrian. Fixing a broken country is more important than power.~
@120  = ~Control? I had more control over what I was doing back in Amn.~
@121  = ~'When gods walk the Realms?' As bad as this is, it's not quite the Time of Troubles.~
@122  = ~I think you underestimate my grasp on the situation.~
@123  = ~Yes. Speaking of which, I'm sure that by now, I don't have to warn you not to trust anybody.~
@124  = ~Is it? You may be the only person in Tethyr who thinks that, <CHARNAME>. I'm sure that by now, I don't have to warn you not to trust anybody.~
@125  = ~Well, I'd best get used to the smoke and mirrors, then. But with so many other potential interests in play... I'm sure that by now, I don't have to warn you not to trust anybody.~
@126  = ~No, but it's nearly as confusing. Speaking of which, I'm sure that by now, I don't have to warn you not to trust anybody.~
@127  = ~Don't get overconfident, <CHARNAME>. Speaking of which, I'm sure that by now, I don't have to warn you not to trust anybody.~
@128  = ~I feel like we've been thrown into this mess in the middle, and that makes determining motives even more difficult.~
@129  = ~It is a bit like walking into a theater in the middle of a performance and trying to figure out what's going on.~
@130  = ~Stop being so paranoid. If you expect a knife in the back, you're likely to get it.~
@131  = ~Don't trust anyone... tell me, does that include you?~
@132  = ~When have I ever succeeded by trusting anyone? I don't intend to start now.~
@133  = ~Not necessarily the metaphor I would have used, but... yes. I suppose so. Still, we won't figure things out by simply standing around and talking about them.~
@134  = ~Very funny, my dear. Please, just keep it in mind.~
@135  = ~I'm not quite paranoid enough to take that as a threat, but... fine. I won't bring it up again.~
@136  = ~Mmm, I suppose that depends on what you expect from me, my dear. Regardless, we won't figure things out by simply standing around and talking about them.~
@137  = ~I dare say I have too much invested in this to betray you now.~
@138  = ~You're teasing me, aren't you? Of all the foolish-- let's just move on, <CHARNAME>.~
@139  = ~Good. I expected nothing less.~
@140  = ~Could you leave that lamp a moment longer, <CHARNAME>? I'm just about finished reading this.~
@141  = ~What is it this time? Another treatise on enchantment?~
@142  = ~I wish you'd spend more time researching spells and less time fixating on theory.~
@143  = ~You can finish it in the morning, can't you?~
@144  = ~Here I am, ready for bed... and all he wants to do is read.~
@145  = ~If that's a lady's romance novel masquerading as an arcane tome, you're never going to live it down.~
@146  = ~Take it elsewhere if you want to read it. I'm going to sleep.~
@147  = ~No... this one is actually necromancy. Shocking, I know. I suppose that after all of this chaos, developing a bit of a morbid fascination with death is as much as can be expected.~
@148  = ~The two do bleed together, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, and what can be found in a dusty tome on necromancy can often enough be used against our undead foes.~
@149  = ~(smile) I've heard that there are books out there that turn into dust and mist when left overnight... but a tome of necromancy is usually not one of them.~
@150  = ~Mmm, my love, if you had that in mind, you probably should have warned me away from the necromantic theory some time ago. My thoughts are... fairly dark right now.~
@151  = ~Heavens forfend. No, I dare say a tome devoted to necromantic theory is about the furthest thing *from*.~
@152  = ~As you insist.~
@153  = ~Don't go hunting for my phylactery just yet, but I guess I can't help but find the subject somewhat intriguing. Eternal life... a mage's one true obsession.~
@154  = ~You know, they say that all lichs are insane.~
@155  = ~Then it's a good thing that I won't have to resort to that method of obtaining immortality.~
@156  = ~I hope you're not dreaming of being Faerun's first sane one.~
@157  = ~This isn't still about what Bodhi did to you, is it?~
@158  = ~Anyone who'd embrace lichdom was probably mad to begin with.~
@159  = ~If I were ice cold and decaying from within, I'd be insane as well.~
@160  = ~Who needs sanity when you can have power like that?~
@161  = ~Yes, I can't deny that you have... other options. Better ones, maybe, though I'm not entirely certain that worse ones even exist.~
@162  = ~It's a terrible thought, isn't it? Perhaps they're still themselves, somewhere beneath the madness and decay, and perhaps... perhaps it would be better if they were not.~
@163  = ~Hells, no. Even if I were interested in cold, dead flesh... well, it's a terrible thought, isn't it? Perhaps they're still themselves, somewhere beneath the madness and decay, and perhaps... perhaps it would be better if they were not.~
@164  = ~My own brief brush with undeath... yes, I suppose that's part of the fascination. Bad enough to be forced into it, but to do it willingly... I don't know.~
@165  = ~But it's a terrible thought, isn't it? Perhaps they're still themselves, somewhere beneath the madness and decay, and perhaps... perhaps it would be better if they were not.~
@166  = ~That may well be part of it. Otherwise... well, it's a terrible thought, isn't it? Perhaps they're still themselves, underneath the madness and decay, and perhaps... perhaps it would be better if they were not.~
@167  = ~Indeed. I must admit that I share your priorities, <CHARNAME>. And even if a lich didn't always look his age... well, it's a terrible thought, isn't it?~
@168  = ~Perhaps they're still themselves, somewhere beneath the madness and decay, and perhaps... perhaps it would be better if they were not.~
@169  = ~Who indeed? Though sometimes I wonder if it's more than mere sanity that they've lost. Perhaps they're still themselves, somewhere beneath the madness and decay, and perhaps... perhaps it would be better if they were not.~
@170  = ~I can't help but imagine some helpless shred of a mortal soul, trapped within a monster's dead mind for all of eternity. Screaming... knowing in the end that he did it to himself.~
@171  = ~Even for you, this is morbid. Where is this coming from?~
@172  = ~Don't be ridiculous. If we let every premonition of dread stand between where we want to be, we'd never get anywhere at all.~
@173  = ~Is it ghost story time? I've got a couple good ones I've been meaning to share.~
@174  = ~Enough necromantic bedtime reading for you. It's my enemies who are supposed to give me nightmares, not my allies.~
@175  = ~A <PRO_MANWOMAN> evil enough to tempt fate like that deserves whatever <PRO_HESHE> gets.~
@176  = ~I can't help but imagine some helpless shred of a mortal soul, trapped within a monster's dead mind for all of eternity. Screaming... knowing in the end that he did it to himself. Heh.~
@177  = ~A person evil enough to tempt fate like that deserves whatever they get.~
@178  = ~Morbid? Perhaps. I tend to keep my darker thoughts to myself, <CHARNAME>.~
@179  = ~Don't mistake caution for cowardice, <CHARNAME>. There are only a handful of truly great people in the Realms... that isn't by accident.~
@180  = ~Heh. Make light of it, if you wish.~
@181  = ~Heh. That's hardly my intention, <CHARNAME>.~
@182  = ~Does <PRO_HESHE>? Perhaps. Still, eternity is a long time to pay.~
@183  = ~I tend to keep my darker thoughts to myself, <CHARNAME>. But tonight... well. They seem to be creeping back in.~
@184  = ~There are worse places to be than nowhere... or so I've been told. I tend to keep my darker thoughts to myself, but tonight... well. They seem to be creeping back in.~
@185  = ~Unless it ends horrifically, I'm not interested. I tend to keep my darker thoughts to myself, but tonight... well. They seem to be creeping back in.~
@186  = ~Yes, and I dare say your enemies have had that honor for far too long as it is.  I tend to keep my darker thoughts to myself, but tonight... well. They seem to be creeping back in.~
@187  = ~Mmm, and eternity is quite a long time to pay. I tend to keep my darker thoughts to myself, but tonight... well. They seem to be creeping back in.~
@188  = ~I suppose I've just learned too much to take things like this for granted anymore. In situations where you can't really know what you're getting into until it's much too late to get out again...~
@189  = ~Well, I would be very careful about wagering everything.~
@190  = ~We always wager everything. I haven't lost yet.~
@191  = ~You're not talking about lichs anymore, I gather.~
@192  = ~I'd be wary of wagering anything at all if I could help it.~
@193  = ~Enough talk, Adrian... I had more in mind for tonight than arcane philosophy.~
@194  = ~No more theoretically treatises if they're just going to make you cryptic.~
@195  = ~I'm not the one here researching lichdom, you know. Go lecture yourself instead.~
@196  = ~No, so far you've been lucky. If that means that you always will be... I guess we can only wait and hope.~
@197  = ~No, I don't suppose I am. Whatever happens next, <CHARNAME>, whatever comes... just be careful.~
@198  = ~Heh. No, I suppose you've never been much of a gambler, have you? Maybe that's for the best.~
@199  = ~Mmm, at this point, I dare say that would be a most welcome distraction anyway, my dear. Not that it isn't always.~
@200  = ~Cryptic, is it? I guess I can only say that whatever happens next, whatever comes... just be careful.~
@201  = ~There's more to it than just lichdom, <CHARNAME>. Whatever happens next, whatever comes... just be careful.~
@202  = ~He... deserved it, you know. Irenicus. Whatever it was that the Seldarine did to him... he deserved it. I can only pray that his afterlife is as... pleasant as his former one was.~
@203  = ~He wasn't quite an undead thing. That was his sister.~
@204  = ~You really need to let this go, Adrian.~
@205  = ~A sentiment I heartily agree with.~
@206  = ~I think we need to keep you away from the theoretically treatises in the future.~
@207  = ~Couldn't you focus on our Bhaalspawn adversaries instead for once?~
@208  = ~So it was. But nevermind the rest of my superstitious nonsense, <CHARNAME>. I... suppose you eventually get to a point where there's nowhere left to go but forward.~
@209  = ~Hmm, perhaps. But nevermind the rest of my superstitious nonsense, <CHARNAME>. I... suppose you eventually get to a point where there's nowhere left to go but forward.~
@210  = ~I thought you would. But nevermind the rest of my superstitious nonsense, <CHARNAME>. I... suppose you eventually get to a point where there's nowhere left to go but forward.~
@211  = ~Hmm, I do try. I... suppose you eventually get to a point where there's nowhere left to go but forward.~
@212  = ~Hells, this place... I'm glad I converted ten years ago if my eternity would have otherwise looked remotely like this.~
@213  = ~It could do with a bit of redecorating, I dare say.~
@214  = ~Very funny. We're a little bit busy for frivolities.~
@215  = ~That's my divine father's taste you're insulting there.~
@216  = ~Absolutely! Put up a few tapestries, some Chessentan statues, and it's as good as home.~
@217  = ~It is kind of creepy, isn't it?~
@218  = ~You're welcome to if you want to, but I really don't have time for this right now.~
@219  = ~Frivolous, am I? By all the gods, <CHARNAME>, if this is a manifestation of your soul, your head must be an even more frightening place than mine.~
@220  = ~So it is. By all the gods, <CHARNAME>, if this is a manifestation of your soul, then your head must be an even more frightening place than mine.~
@221  = ~Even a couple of marble sculpture won't fix this. By all the gods, <CHARNAME>, if this is a manifestation of your soul, your head must be an even more frightening place than mine.~
@222  = ~No? If I'm such a pest, I'm not sure why you keep me around at all.~
@223  = ~Dammit, would you stop staring at me like that?~
@224  = ~Staring? I was barely glancing at you.~
@225  = ~You've been acting strange all <DAYNIGHT>, Adrian. What's wrong?~
@226  = ~Oh, not this nonsense again. I thought we were over this.~
@227  = ~Too damn bad. I'll look wherever I want.~
@228  = ~I... hells, just listen to me.~
@229  = ~Wrong? Why would anything be wrong? I... hells, just listen to me.~
@230  = ~Yes, you'll do whatever you damn well please, won't you? I... hells, just listen to me.~
@231  = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I don't mean to be difficult, but this place... I suppose it's harder to ignore the reality of the situation when the evidence is all around me.~
@232  = ~You're forgiven. It's not as if I'm not used to this by now.~
@233  = ~For someone so fond of reason, you really are one of the most high-strung men I know.~
@234  = ~The reality of the situation? What exactly are you afraid of?~
@235  = ~The reality of the situation? The unspoken offer, you mean. Maybe we should sit down and discuss this.~
@236  = ~I'm going to have to ask you to make it up to me to<DAYNIGHT>. As creatively as possible.~
@237  = ~I'm tired of this nonsense, Adrian. I thought it was going to stop after Suldanessellar, but apparently it hasn't. We're done here.~
@238  = ~(sigh) You shouldn't have to be.~
@239  = ~(sigh) I won't bother trying to deny that.~
@240  = ~That would probably be a good idea.~
@241  = ~Mmm, as glad as I am that you're not angry with me, we really do need to talk.~
@242  = ~I... see. I'll leave you alone, then.~
@243  = ~I should have said something quite some time ago, I suppose, but... well, we both know how good I am at that. This damn Solar can only be here for one reason, <CHARNAME>, and... we both know what your future could hold.~
@244  = ~I don't want to pressure you one way or the other, but I do need to know what you're thinking. I... can't just pretend that this will go away if I ignore it. Obviously I've tried.~
@245  = ~I can't give you certainty. I haven't made a decision myself.~
@246  = ~I only hope that I'll have a choice in the matter, one way or the other.~
@247  = ~The Solar's promises may never amount to anything. We could all die before this is over.~
@248  = ~You don't know me very well if you think I've any interest in taking up Bhaal's mantle.~
@249  = ~If it were Sune or Sharess, I wouldn't refuse, but my father's legacy... no thank you.~
@250  = ~With the power I have right now, I'd rather be a force amongst mortals than a weak and fledgling deity.~
@251  = ~You can't honestly expect me to give up the opportunity to become a goddess.~
@252  = ~Frankly, it's none of your business.~
@253  = ~You're going to have to, <CHARNAME>, and sooner rather than later. This isn't the sort of decision that you leave to the last moment.~
@254  = ~All my best decisions were made at the last moment. When the time comes, I'll choose whatever feels right.~
@255  = ~After everything I've been put through because of this prophesy, it seems unthinkable to ignore the rewards.~
@256  = ~I'm tired of gods and prophesies. That's as good a reason as any to stay mortal.~
@257  = ~Please. I need a real answer, even if you don't.~
@258  = ~I can't give you one. I'm sorry.~
@259  = ~After everything I've been put through because of this prophesy, it does seem unthinkable to ignore the rewards.~
@260  = ~You probably will. The gentler gods tend to appreciate free will, and the crueler ones... well, they wouldn't care for a new rival regardless. I don't think it'll be forced upon you.~
@261  = ~I still can't give you certainty. I haven't made a decision myself.~
@262  = ~If I can turn it down, I will. I have no interest in taking up Bhaal's mantle.~
@263  = ~In that case, If it were Sune or Sharess, I wouldn't refuse, but my father's legacy... no thank you.~
@264  = ~Regardless, you can't honestly expect me to give up the opportunity to become a goddess.~
@265  = ~I'm fully aware of that. As... comforting a thought as it is, it somehow doesn't help me sleep at night. You must have some thoughts on the matter.~
@266  = ~No, being a goddess of murder doesn't much sound like you at all, but don't forget that deities do branch out. They say that the reborn Mystra is nothing like the old one, and you're even less like Bhaal.~
@267  = ~Mmm, and what a goddess of pleasure and passion you would be, my dear. But don't forget that deities do branch out. They say that the reborn Mystra is nothing like the old one, and you're even less like Bhaal.~
@268  = ~I wouldn't care for having Cyric watching me, waiting for any opportunity to strike either. But I don't believe you incapable of competing in the divine arena.~
@269  = ~It's not an opportunity to reject lightly. Many spend their entire lives chasing such dreams.~
@270  = ~I just said no. Are you trying to talk me into accepting godhood?~
@271  = ~Many spend their lives foolishly. I don't intend to do so, and I won't spend it anywhere but here.~
@272  = ~I have more faith in mortals than in gods anyway. I have no desire to become one.~
@273  = ~When you put it like that, after everything I've been put through because of this prophesy, it does seem unthinkable to ignore the rewards.~
@274  = ~No, <CHARNAME>. But I don't want to pretend that this should be an easy decision.~
@275  = ~I hope by 'here', you don't mean Tethyr. I'd hate to spend a moment more than necessary in this gods forsaken corner of Faerun.~
@276  = ~After all of this, I can't say I blame you.~
@277  = ~And now I feel doubly foolish for not bringing this up earlier... and for practically attacking you at first. I can't promise that it won't happen again, but... I am trying.~
@278  = ~I know you are. I'm not holding it against you, and I wish you wouldn't either.~
@279  = ~Not hard enough, apparently. Come, let's put this behind us. There's work to be done.~
@280  = ~If this is how you tried to get information out of people in Sembia, it's no wonder you were chased away.~
@281  = ~I have to make a promise, and he refuses to make one in return.~
@282  = ~As my lady wishes. But... thank you.~
@283  = ~I suppose I deserved that.~
@284  = ~Suddenly so literal. But I suppose I deserved that.~
@285  = ~I see. I don't begrudge you that choice. Hells, I can certainly understand it, but... that doesn't change anything.~
@286  = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I'd rather end this cleanly now than risk poisoning it later.~
@287  = ~I see. I suppose that alone is all the answer I needed.~
@288  = ~We Banites were always more spartan than... grotesque, but if my eternity would have looked remotely like this, I'm glad I finally converted.~
@289  = ~As your future throne room, I dare say it could do with a bit of redecorating.~
@290  = ~Future throne room? You honestly think I want this?~
@291  = ~Indeed. We do, after all, have your future rule to consolidate.~
@292  = ~And what exquisite taste it is. Well, as long as you don't share it, I shouldn't complain.~
@293  = ~You could try, but I dare say that would just accentuate the obvious flaws.~
@294  = ~Well, given the exquisitely poor taste involved, I certainly wouldn't.~
@295  = ~No, I can't say I find that surprising.~
@296  = ~Forgive me the jests, <CHARNAME>. I suppose I've too long a history with dark gods to react to something like this in a remotely normal fashion.~
@297  = ~At least you're not descended from one.~
@298  = ~You once worshipped Bane?~
@299  = ~You were once a Banite? I hope Keldorn doesn't know.~
@300  = ~You're going to see quite a bit more of them before this crisis is over.~
@301  = ~I don't think any of us are reacting to this place in a normal fashion. We haven't run away screaming yet.~
@302  = ~True. I've always had enough problems with my family as it is, but at least we never called places like this home.~
@303  = ~A long time ago, yes. My city was practically the seat of his worship, so it was somewhat inevitable. This place, though...~
@304  = ~He certainly suspects. I don't think he minds much what happened ten years ago, but I'd rather not test that theory. This place, though...~
@305  = ~And afterwards... well, who knows? This place, though...~
@306  = ~Heh. Yes, that would be the most proper reaction.~
@307  = ~I suppose there's no real reason to assume that your own future divine realm would be quite so hideous... they say that the reborn Mystra is nothing like the old one, and you're not quite as singleminded as Bhaal was.~
@308  = ~I assume you've put some thought into the possibility?~
@309  = ~You're rather cavalier about this. Weren't you warning me to be careful earlier?~
@310  = ~I have no interest in taking up Bhaal's mantle.~
@311  = ~As it so happens, I've already been planning my divine career.~
@312  = ~It's too great an opportunity to refuse.~
@313  = ~Whether or not I've put some thought into it is no concern of yours.~
@314  = ~With the lichs? I'd say that the thoughts that haunt us at night disappear come morning, but that wouldn't quite be true.~
@315  = ~I would be wary, yes, but I won't pretend that the two scenarios are exactly the same.~
@316  = ~No, being a goddess of murder doesn't much sound like you at all, but don't forget that deities do branch out.~
@317  = ~No, being a god of murder doesn't much sound like you at all, but don't forget that deities do branch out.~
@318  = ~Have you? I'd warn you not to let future possibilities distract you from the reality of the present, but you seem to have things well enough in hand as it is.~
@319  = ~To reject out of hand... yes. To refuse, I'm not quite sure.~
@320  = ~I don't disagree.~
@321  = ~No, I suppose not. If you don't want counsel, I certainly won't force it upon you.~
@322  = ~I don't mean to sway you one way or the other, <CHARNAME>. Heavens know, if I were offered the option myself, I'm not sure what I would say.~
@323  = ~Don't pretend that you wouldn't agree in a heartbeat.~
@324  = ~I've been offered the option and I still can't make a decision.~
@325  = ~If you're not sure, that means the answer is "no".~
@326  = ~I'm sure you'd analyze every possible drawback up until the offer was revoked.~
@327  = ~Then you're fortunate that it's a choice you'll never have to make.~
@328  = ~A heartbeat? No, I'm not quite so impulsive as that these days. And with a decision like this, you probably shouldn't be either.~
@329  = ~I understand that, but you're going to have to, you know, and sooner rather than later. This isn't the sort of decision that you leave to the last moment.~
@330  = ~You're right, I think. Any doubt in a decision like this... I would hate to spend the rest of eternity with regrets.~
@331  = ~I take it that you're certain, then?~
@332  = ~Completely.~
@333  = ~I'm still thinking things through, but I'm getting there.~
@334  = ~Certain? The only thing I know for sure is that I don't understand what I'd be getting myself into.~
@335  = ~And I doubt that I'd regret it. It's best to be fully aware of the benefits and drawbacks.~
@336  = ~Ha! Forgive my idle ruminations then. I only mean to say... well.~
@337  = ~If and when the time comes, <CHARNAME>, whatever your choice is, make sure that you have no doubts.~
@338  = ~I'll keep that in mind, thank you.~
@339  = ~You don't need to tell me that this is serious. I'm fully aware of that.~
@340  = ~Everyone has doubts. There's no difference between living with them for a mortal lifetime and living with them for eternity.~
@341  = ~Not too long ago, I would have expected you to be hoping for divine handouts instead. This is a pleasant surprise.~
@342  = ~Good. Odd as it may seem, I don't envy you the choice.~
@343  = ~Gods and mortals interact on different planes entirely... if that's your rationale, <CHARNAME>, you're wiser than most.~
@344  = ~Only a matter of degree, I suppose.~
@345  = ~Heh. Just keep it in mind. Odd as it may seem, I don't envy you this choice.~
@346  = ~In any case, divinity... hells. I certainly wouldn't mind the chance to leave every mortal care and concern behind.~
@347  = ~That doesn't sound promising. Are you alright?~
@348  = ~I can't imagine that your cares and concerns are anything compared to mine.~
@349  = ~And here I was told that the key feature was the nigh unlimited power.~
@350  = ~I'd rather be myself, with or without the daily strain.~
@351  = ~If you don't stop annoying me, I can certainly have that arranged.~
@352  = ~I'm angry. I've been angry since we left Suldanessellar, but it's nothing to worry yourself over.~
@353  = ~Perhaps not, but I'm still angry. I've been angry since we left Suldanessellar, though it's nothing to worry yourself over.~
@354  = ~Well, I wouldn't turn that down either.~ ~Never mind me, <CHARNAME>. I suppose I'm still angry... I've been angry since we left Suldanessellar, though it's nothing to worry yourself over.~
@355  = ~And how's that working out for you?~ ~...I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I suppose I'm still angry... I've been angry since we left Suldanessellar, though it's nothing to worry yourself over.~
@356  = ~How very typical.~
@357  = ~When the time comes... well. Just don't make a decision you'll regret.~
@358  = ~I didn't intend to.~
@359  = ~What, are you hoping for divine handouts?~
@360  = ~Thank you for the advice. I think.~
@361  = ~Don't blow me off like that. What's bothering you?~
@362  = ~Well, bad decisions have always been within your purview anyway, not mine.~
@363  = ~Most people don't.~
@364  = ~I should hope that I'm not quite as transparent as that.~
@365  = ~My pleasure.~
@366  = ~I should think you had enough on your mind already.~
@367  = ~Very clever, <CHARNAME>.~
@368  = ~Odd of me to still be so haunted by that cesspit of a Tethyrian city.~
@369  = ~I'd have expected that enough time would dull the wounds... especially when those wounds aren't technically mine.~
@370  = ~You'd better get used to it. I certainly am.~
@371  = ~All of those people slaughtered... could you at least show some respect?~
@372  = ~I think we're all haunted by what happened in Saradush.~
@373  = ~So you care after all, do you? I was beginning to wonder.~
@374  = ~I have no desire to talk about Saradush, now or ever.~
@375  = ~You'd think that I would be by now also.~
@376  = ~Respect? Will the dead rest any more easily if I comment politely?~
@377  = ~I'll leave you alone, then.~
@378  = ~This wasn't my first siege. Obviously. After what happened in Zhentil Keep... gods. I can only pray that this will be my last, but I'd be a fool not to expect the worst.~
@379  = ~I'm not sure I could handle another sight like Saradush myself.~
@380  = ~At least there's nothing in Amkethran worth razing to the ground.~
@381  = ~This whole country has a way of opening up old wounds.~
@382  = ~It won't happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.~
@383  = ~You'd be more foolish to abandon all hope entirely.~
@384  = ~You may have to. You have to realize that. I... hells, <CHARNAME>.~
@385  = ~No? There is *you*, and you're certainly worth an army or two, but... if you're trying to distract me, you haven't quite succeeded.  I... hells, <CHARNAME>.~
@386  = ~Old? They were barely old enough to have scabbed over in the first place. I... hells, <CHARNAME>.~
@387  = ~You may not have a say. You have to realize that. I... hells, <CHARNAME>.~
@388  = ~I'm not talking about hope. I... hells, <CHARNAME>.~
@389  = ~I shut my eyes and I see Saradush again, but it's not the Saradush we actually ever saw... and the bodies strewn across the ground, they're...they're not blackened and half burnt anymore, but blasted into ice instead...~
@390  = ~Gruesome statues frozen forever in their last moments, like...like those crystal sculptures from Calimshan that we used to see in Waukeen's Promenade, I--~
@391  = ~Stop it! I don't want to hear anymore!~
@392  = ~Don't do this, Adrian. It's not going to help you.~
@393  = ~If this has been bothering you so much, why haven't you mentioned anything before?~
@394  = ~They're two different things entirely! Don't conflate them!~
@395  = ~Enough. We're a bit too busy right now to deal with your old nightmares.~
@396  = ~I... no, I don't blame you. I'll be alright. Eventually.~
@397  = ~I... I'll be alright. Eventually.~
@398  = ~It hasn't been. I mean... no more than anything else has, but... I'll be alright. Eventually.~
@399  = ~Entirely? Divine conflict is what it is, regardless of the god, but... I'll be alright. Eventually.~
@400  = ~Right, of course. I'll just... leave you alone, then.~
@401  = ~I... never had a chance to mourn properly, I think. Things just went from bad to worse after the siege, and it was months before I was even free again. I... I don't know. I don't want to think about it.~
@402  = ~Just let me hide behind my dispassion, <CHARNAME>. It's the only shield I have.~
@403  = ~There's this lovely spot, just north of the Moonsea, a bit south of Melvaunt if my geography is correct... Point Moonsea, they call it.~
@404  = ~I've never been there myself, and I don't see that changing anytime soon, if ever, but it would have been nice to have been able to take you there.~
@405  = ~Then why don't we? We're powerful enough by now that any of your old acquaintances would run and hide if they saw us.~
@406  = ~Bittersweet reminiscence, my love? What was so special about the place?~
@407  = ~There are lovely spots everywhere, if we're looking for other options.~
@408  = ~I'd love to visit Candlekeep again myself, but there's nothing much left for me there.~
@409  = ~I don't have the time for this right now.~
@410  = ~As beautiful an image as that is... I don't know. I don't know if I'd want to go back. Even to partake in old traditions.~
@411  = ~Old traditions, my dear. Not quite old wives' tales, but I suppose the distinction there is negligible.~
@412  = ~I won't deny it, <CHARNAME>, but the old traditions... they're somewhat attractive, even now.~
@413  = ~All things considered... no, I don't suppose there is.~
@414  = ~But Point Moonsea... it's less about old memories than old traditions. They're somewhat attractive, even now.~
@415  = ~We'll talk later, then.~
@416  = ~Legends say that couples who exchanged vows there during Selune's feast day would have no strife in their marriage. A silly superstition, I know, but as caught up in prophesy as we are, I can't help but think of it.~
@417  = ~It would be a nice thought even without the prophesies.~
@418  = ~It is kind of silly, but I'm glad you told me about it anyway.~
@419  = ~No strife? It's more than a bit late for that, I'd say.~
@420  = ~I'm surprised you even have legends like that. I thought you people were all trying to conquer the world.~
@421  = ~Do we need to waste time on nonsense like this?~
@422  = ~I suppose it would be. We tend to be a superstitious crowd back home in general.~
@423  = ~Mmm, we tend to be a superstitious crowd back home in general, I suppose.~
@424  = ~Mmm, and perhaps we've had enough divine intervention as it is. Still, I'm entitled to a couple of odd superstitions.~
@425  = ~It isn't as if everyone who lives on the Moonsea is a tyrant. Just the more interesting ones. But we tend to be a superstitious crowd in general, I suppose.~
@426  = ~I thought... oh, never mind. I won't mention it again.~
@427  = ~Be in the right place at the right time and you win a goddess's favor... compared to the curses that seem to follow us, that would be welcome. Heavens know, even the illusion of peace is hard enough to come by these days.~
@428  = ~If we ever have a chance after this mess is over, I think I'd like to visit a spot like that.~
@429  = ~I think I would like that too.~
@430  = ~And exchange vows, perhaps?~
@431  = ~Adrian, are you trying to propose to me?~
@432  = ~We don't need superstition and ritual to make our relationship work.~
@433  = ~I'm not sure I like where this is headed.~
@434  = ~I would hardly refuse, my dear.~
@435  = ~It is something we should probably discuss at some point.~
@436  = ~No, but it doesn't hurt.~
@437  = ~It isn't headed anywhere you don't want it to go, <CHARNAME>. Oh, never mind.~
@438  = ~It would be nice, I think, to have a marriage sanctified by a god other than Bane. There are precious few Sunites back home, though, and I can't say I've ever before been in a relationship that the lady Firehair would have cared to recognize anyway.~
@439  = ~But you... I do love you, <CHARNAME>. If you'd care to head back to Amn after this is over and hunt down one of their priestesses of Sune, I certainly wouldn't complain.~
@440  = ~I would like nothing more.~
@441  = ~As lovely as that sounds, I think I would prefer a different church.~
@442  = ~Proposals aren't supposed to be quite so nonchalant, you know.~
@443  = ~Hunt down? You make it sound like a chase, not a wedding!~
@444  = ~I'm not really interested in marriage.~
@445  = ~(smile) Then that makes me look foward to the end of this mad adventure even more than I already was.~
@446  = ~(smile) Well, I suppose it's somewhat premature to start planning it just yet, but you're welcome to choose whichever church you'd like.~
@447  = ~My lady, we've been through too much as it is to blow something so simple out of proportion.~
@448  = ~Honestly, my lady, could you focus on the question rather than the wording?~
@449  = ~Would you like to or not?~
@450  = ~I'd like nothing more.~
@451  = ~Yes, but I think I'd prefer a different church.~
@452  = ~It's a bit... soon, don't you think?~
@453  = ~I'll need to think about it.~
@454  = ~No, I suppose that there's been too much symbolism in your life to welcome anymore. If you'd rather not, I don't mind, but a chance to get away after all of this... that I'd still enjoy.~
@455  = ~I'm more used to arranged marriages than something like this, but if you'd rather wait, I won't complain. A chance to get away after all of this, though... that I'd still enjoy.~
@456  = ~Then take your time. And if it isn't something you want to do, I won't complain. A chance to get away after all of this, though... that I'd still enjoy.~
@457  = ~But for now... we can spare at least a couple moments, I hope.~
@458  = ~Why, did you have something interesting in mind?~
@459  = ~I could spare a good deal more than that.~
@460  = ~You've got quite the gleam in your eyes right now, my love.~
@461  = ~As much as I wish it were otherwise, we do need to move on.~
@462  = ~Mmm, well... there's not enough privacy right now to really get carried away, but I'm sure we can think of something.~
@463  = ~Do I? Mmm, well... there's not enough privacy right now to really get carried away, but that doesn't mean we can't think of something.~
@464  = ~Ah, well. A pity.~
@465  = ~Have you given any thought to what you'd like to do when this is all over?~
@466  = ~We may not even live to see the end of this.~
@467  = ~I'm not sure I'll have much of a choice. I never have before.~
@468  = ~I think I'd like to settle down somewhere, try for a normal life.~
@469  = ~I imagine I'll probably just follow the road where it leads me.~
@470  = ~I hope to finally gain some political power in one of these cities that owe me everything.~
@471  = ~Conquest is looking better and better. All these countries need my intervention anyway.~
@472  = ~I won't deny that, but formulating a back-up plan on the off chance that we survive is a pleasant enough diversion, isn't it?~
@473  = ~Things change, <CHARNAME>, and you're becoming more powerful. Exponentially so. It would be nice to have some sort of plan.~
@474  = ~A normal life for a daughter of Bhaal... a nice fantasy, though if anyone could turn it into reality, it would be you.~
@475  = ~We'd best move to Mulhorand or Maztica or somewhere equally barbaric if we want to avoid attention, though.~
@476  = ~The road leads everywhere, <CHARNAME>. The choice of direction is entirely yours.~
@477  = ~Couldn't we pick a new city altogether?~
@478  = ~Heh. That's always the answer, isn't it?~
@479  = ~Myself, I'm tired of the sun-blasted south. Heading back north... well, I'm not sure I'd be welcome anywhere west of the Inland Sea, but the northern countries... hmm, they haven't had a tyrant in Vaasa in about a decade.~
@480  = ~(smile) I dare say the country is ripe for new leadership.~
@481  = ~I do hope you're joking.~
@482  = ~I'd rather do something productive with my life, Adrian.~
@483  = ~Witch-Queen of Vaasa. I do like the sound of that.~
@484  = ~To carve out a kingdom in a remote part of the world... I like it.~
@485  = ~Could you pick someplace a bit less barbaric?~
@486  = ~Don't be ridiculous. We'd get torn from power within a decade.~
@487  = ~Heh. No, it's an idle fantasy, <CHARNAME>. Nothing more. And probably a bit too close to home for me anyway. Perhaps we could take Minsc back to Rashemen. Cold weather, no Harpers or Zhents. Not many elves either.~
@488  = ~Heh. No, it's an idle fantasy, <CHARNAME>. Nothing more. And probably a bit too close to home for me anyway. Perhaps we could head out to Rashemen in the far east. Cold weather, no Harpers or Zhents. Not many elves either.~
@489  = ~Perhaps we could take Minsc back to Rashemen, then. Cold weather, no Harpers or Zhents, and I imagine the country is ethical enough to suit your tastes. Spending your days helping to protect Faerun from the ravages of the Red Wizards...~
@490  = ~Perhaps we could head out to Rashemen in the far east, then. Cold weather, no Harpers or Zhents, and I imagine the country is ethical enough to suit your tastes. Spending your days helping to protect Faerun from the ravages of the Red Wizards...~
@491  = ~I doubt the Witches would care much for me, but they're likely to appreciate any competent help in their struggle against Thay, and I do enjoy a good feud.~
@492  = ~The exotic east... I think I'd enjoy that.~
@493  = ~It's probably a bit too far from home for my tastes.~
@494  = ~We could do better than that, my love. Maztica. Kara-tur. If we're very lucky, perhaps we'll find a portal to Sigil.~
@495  = ~It might be nice to visit, but to stay there... a settled life just isn't for me.~
@496  = ~You're sure you don't like Amn?~
@497  = ~I've heard it's a lovely country. Maybe a bit too wild for my tastes, but  what's the harm in dreaming?~
@498  = ~In more ways than one. I probably couldn't handle more than a month of it before going mad, but what's the harm in dreaming?~
@499  = ~City of cities... I've always wondered. Well, mad as the thought may be, what's the harm in dreaming?~
@500  = ~A settled life in a place like that probably isn't for me either. Still, there's an entire world of options.~
@501  = ~Completely, love. Ah, mad as the thought may be, what's the harm in dreaming?~
@502  = ~You are a wizardess not to be trifled with, my love. The title becomes you.~
@503  = ~You would, wouldn't you?~
@504  = ~Jests aside, I've mostly lost my taste for tyranny, but I don't think I could deny you anything.~
@505  = ~Darling, I was just joking. I'd think you would have understood that by now.~
@506  = ~We don't need to be tyrants. That doesn't mean that a place like that couldn't use a bit more order.~
@507  = ~You're right. You couldn't. That's one of the things I love most about you.~
@508  = ~Forget Vaasa, then. You know, I've always wanted to try my hand at the normal games of politics.~
@509  = ~I think I'd prefer to, actually. I'm sure there's a thieves' guild out east that would take us in. Thesk, perhaps. I heard mention of their Shadowmasters a time or two back in Sembia.~
@510  = ~You're probably right. If you'd prefer something a bit more low-key, I'm sure there's a thieves' guild out east that would take us in. Thesk, perhaps. I heard mention of their Shadowmasters a time or two back in Sembia.~
@511  = ~You've certainly developed enough skill at dealing with the thugs.~
@512  = ~Forget about thieves. I've always wanted to try my hand at the normal games of politics.~
@513  = ~Best not underestimate them, my dear.~
@514  = ~That sounds wonderfully exotic.~
@515  = ~Politics... closer to conquest than you'd think, especially at the highest levels. I didn't prove that skilled at it, but... well, if once you fail, try again, I suppose.~
@516  = ~Perhaps that's true.~
@517  = ~Sometimes it's hard to tell with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@518  = ~Mmm, don't push your luck, my dear.~
@519  = ~That you do.~
@520  = ~You needn't worry, my dear. I take them seriously enough.~
@521  = ~I can sympathize with that.~
@522  = ~It certainly does.~
@523  = ~But I'm getting ahead of myself, I know. It's too soon to talk about this now with your mad prophesy breathing down the back of our necks.~
@524  = ~I like discussing it anyway. I like to think that we'll have a real future, whatever it may be.~
@525  = ~It isn't *my* prophesy, Adrian. I'd rather have nothing to do with it.~
@526  = ~I'll take any distraction from these prophesies.~
@527  = ~I enjoy your mad daydreams all the same.~
@528  = ~There are a lot of things that we shouldn't be doing with matters this serious, but that's never stopped us before.~
@529  = ~You're right. The whole discussion is pointless.~
@530  = ~A real future... well, we've as good a chance as getting through this as anyone, and better than most.~
@531  = ~I know, <CHARNAME>. But... it can't last forever, and we've as good a chance as getting through this as anyone. Better than most.~
@532  = ~(smile) Any distraction, you say? I'm glad my fantasies amuse you.~
@533  = ~(smile) I'm glad to hear it, even if mad daydreams are all they are.~
@534  = ~(smile) Matters are never too serious for that.~
@535  = ~Ignore my mad fantasies, then.~
@536  = ~With some luck, perhaps we won't even need to flee to the other side of the world afterwards to find someplace we won't be hunted. I'd like that, I think.~
@537  = ~Don't count on it.~
@538  = ~The Bhaalspawn hysteria will have to die down at some point.~
@539  = ~But where would be the fun in that?~
@540  = ~I think people will be more tolerant of you than you seem to believe.~
@541  = ~People will remember the good we've done. That will make a difference in the end.~
@542  = ~I wouldn't rule it out. Power is welcome in quite a few places, and we've certainly accumulated enough of that. With any luck, that will make the difference in the end.~
@543  = ~Heh. My dear, you are incorrigible.~
@544  = ~Perhaps. Regardless, power is welcome in quite a few places, and we've certainly accumulated enough of that. Maybe that will make the difference in the end.~
@545  = ~He was right, you know. The only person who ever cared about me when I was younger, and I left him to die.~
@546  = ~That thing was just trying to upset you. Let it go. It's over now.~
@547  = ~It's not your fault. There was nothing you could have done.~
@548  = ~If he really cared about you, he would have been glad that you got out alive.~
@549  = ~I must admit, I am surprised that you did nothing at all.~
@550  = ~That hardly matters.~
@551  = ~You shouldn't be.~
@552  = ~I couldn't even run properly... I ran straight into another Cormyrian patrol anyway. Even they recognized that I was useless and let me go quickly enough.~
@553  = ~Adrian, stop it. Whatever happened, it was decades ago.~
@554  = ~Snap out of it. You're just letting that creature win.~
@555  = ~You were barely more than a child. What were they going to do, murder you because of who your relatives were?~
@556  = ~That doesn't change anything.~
@557  = ~It's dead now, <CHARNAME>. It can't win. And don't I know more than a bit about that?~
@558  = ~I wasn't quite as young as that.~
@559  = ~Everyone I've ever really cared for, I've let down in the end. And it certainly isn't as if there have been that many of them.~
@560  = ~You... hells, <CHARNAME>, you'll probably be next. Maybe... maybe we should just stop this now, before I hurt you too.~
@561  = ~You're not who you were, Adrian. You've learned from your past mistakes.~
@562  = ~No. You've followed me to the Hells and back. I haven't let your past scare me away before and I'm not going to start now.~
@563  = ~You're not the only one who's ever let someone down. When Gorion was cut down by Sarevok... I ran too.~
@564  = ~Don't say such things, Adrian. You're stronger than this.~
@565  = ~Maybe we should.~
@566  = ~Have I? Sometimes I'm not so sure. I try... I certainly do, but in the end... I guess I'm still the same wreck of a man I always was.~
@567  = ~Have I? It certainly doesn't feel like it.~
@568  = ~And does it even really matter? Nine Hells or not, in the end, I guess I'm still the same wreck of a man I always was.~
@569  = ~To the Hells and back... if only that were enough.~
@570  = ~You... oh. I didn't know that. At least you've come a ways since then. Me... in the end, I guess I'm still the same wreck of a man I always was.~
@571  = ~You... it doesn't make any difference.~
@572  = ~Am I? I don't know. In the end... I guess I'm still the same wreck of a man I always was.~
@573  = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I can't do this right now.~
@574  = ~Right. I'll just... stay away from you, then.~
@575  = ~Just listen to me. Sometimes I don't know why you even put up with this at all.~
@576  = ~Obviously because I care about you.~
@577  = ~Honestly, neither do I right now. You need to pull yourself back together. And quickly.~
@578  = ~Enough. I know that was unpleasant for you, but you need to put it out of your mind.~
@579  = ~If you need some time to yourself, you're welcome to take it.~
@580  = ~If a damned wraith can do this to you, you're more pathetic than I thought.~
@581  = ~(smile) Somehow... somehow that still astounds me. But you're right, I know. There's no point in falling apart over such old memories.~
@582  = ~You're right, I know. There's no point in falling apart over such old memories.~
@583  = ~I'll be alright, I think. Somehow I'm always alright, but... let's not talk about this again. Please.~
@584  = ~Enemy of the state... well, isn't this a familiar feeling.~
@585  = ~This isn't funny, Adrian.~
@586  = ~We've been wrongfully accused. Doesn't that matter to you?~
@587  = ~Welcome to my life. Enjoy the stay.~
@588  = ~What do you normally do when the Crown wants you dead?~
@589  = ~After Amn, it certainly should be.~
@590  = ~Be quiet. I need to concentrate.~
@591  = ~No, I didn't say it was.~
@592  = ~Rightfully, wrongfully... it all bleeds together in the end.~
@593  = ~Yes, you've gotten quite used to this as well, haven't you?~
@594  = ~Usually I make myself scarce. Very, very scarce.~
@595  = ~Ah, well. I never meant to go back to Amn anyway.~
@596  = ~I certainly can't deny that.~
@597  = ~It's a pity laying low until the Tethyrians lose interest isn't much of an option. Your lovely siblings are... far too talented at tracking you down.~
@598  = ~So I've noticed.~
@599  = ~I'm not going to run and hide anyway. There's far too much to be done.~
@600  = ~We'll just have to be more careful in the future.~
@601  = ~They're certainly welcome to try.~
@602  = ~I shouldn't distract you. I'll just have to get used to the fact that soon I'll probably need both hands to count all the Realms I'm barred from.~
@603  = ~That goes without saying.~
@604  = ~And they certainly will.~
@605  = ~But I shouldn't distract you. I'll just have to get used to the fact that soon I'll probably need both hands to count all the Realms I'm barred from.~
@606  = ~What a... delightful man. He's almost as welcoming as the rest of this sad little city of his.~
@607  = ~All things considered, you should be glad we found any welcome at all.~
@608  = ~At least it's civilization again. Sort of.~
@609  = ~Yes, he was almost as friendly and forthcoming as you tend to be.~
@610  = ~Amkethran hardly qualifies as a city, sad and little or otherwise.~
@611  = ~Heh. If he were any colder, he'd be made of ice.~
@612  = ~That is true. Still, I wish I were happier about this entire situation.~
@613  = ~Though considerably less expressive. Regardless, I wish I were happier about this entire situation.~
@614  = ~It barely qualifies as a village. But the locale notwithstanding, I wish I were happier about this entire situation.~
@615  = ~Mmm, this far south, that would be quite unfortunate, wouldn't it? Regardless, I wish I were happier about this entire situation.~
@616  = ~Melissan... call me dependent, but I don't care for her absence.~
@617  = ~Honestly, neither do I.~
@618  = ~We can figure things out on our own. We always have before.~
@619  = ~She seems to be an extremely busy woman. I'm sure she has better places to be.~
@620  = ~My, I'm almost tempted to get jealous.~
@621  = ~What, you need her to hold your hand through this?~
@622  = ~Yes, I'm sure it's part of some evil plot to save the world.~
@623  = ~That's... somewhat encouraging, I suppose. Well, no matter. Far be it from me to try to predict the whims of the insipidly righteous.~
@624  = ~It isn't that. I... well, never mind. Far be it from me to try to predict the whims of the insipidly righteous.~
@625  = ~Yes, I'm sure she does too. I... well, never mind. Far be it from me to try to predict the whims of the insipidly righteous.~
@626  = ~I didn't say that. I... well, never mind. Far be it from me to try to predict the whims of the insipidly righteous.~
@627  = ~Whatever else can be said about her, she does have a mind for strategy. These terrible armies of hers... myself, I've never had much use for traditional warfare.~
@628  = ~You can blame it on the military folk in my family, perhaps, but cut off the head and the rest of the body tends to wither and die.~
@629  = ~Still, if these two are anything like the last ones... well, I never expected this to be pleasant.~
@630  = ~You don't care for the military?~
@631  = ~You seem relatively confident.~
@632  = ~We'll get through them just as easily as the others.~
@633  = ~Knowing my luck, they can only be worse.~
@634  = ~Do you have any ideas of your own, or are you just going to repeat everything Melissan already said?~
@635  = ~No. My uncle was a lieutenant... not Mikail, the other one. And he was enough of an idiot that I can't say I think that highly of armies these days.~
@636  = ~With any luck, I won't have a reason to reconsider that.~
@637  = ~With our military history back home... no, I can't say I think that highly of armies these days. With any luck, I won't have a reason to reconsider that.~
@638  = ~Perhaps. To be more direct than dear Melissan was... if we treat this like an assassination, we might just succeed.~
@639  = ~I hope you're right.~
@640  = ~That does seem a fairly safe bet.~
@641  = ~Aren't you in a pleasant mood? To be more direct than dear Melissan was... treat it like an assassination, and we might just succeed.~
@642  = ~Die... for the Black Sun. I don't care for the sort of attention you're attracting these days, <CHARNAME>.~
@643  = ~At least he can't do more than send blundering assassins after me.~
@644  = ~Frankly, neither do I.~
@645  = ~It's nothing new, really. At this point, the distinction between powerful Bhaalspawn and a god is academic.~
@646  = ~All things considered, it was probably inevitable.~
@647  = ~Well, I can certainly see why you hate him so much.~
@648  = ~Nevertheless, he bends the rules. He always has, and to the hells with the collateral damage.~
@649  = ~I hope you don't actually believe that. The difference is... incomprehensible, for lack of a better word.~
@650  = ~I would tend to agree with that.~
@651  = ~Try living at the center of his worship for a couple of years and you'll really understand.~
@652  = ~He... I can guess what he wanted with you. The blasted Eclipse doesn't take too kindly to rivals.~
@653  = ~But I don't need to be his rival... I want nothing to do with Bhaal's legacy.~
@654  = ~Eclipse? What is that, a pun?~
@655  = ~He'd better get used to it, because I'm not going anywhere.~
@656  = ~I can only hope he won't continue to complicate matters.~
@657  = ~At least he's forbidden from interfering beyond that.~
@658  = ~I don't want to talk about what just happened, Adrian.~
@659  = ~Don't expect rationality from the God of Madness, <CHARNAME>. He isn't supposed to make sense.~
@660  = ~A nickname he earned when he accidentally razed my city to the ground.~
@661  = ~I would say not to tempt him more, but his relative helplessness here really is delicious.~
@662  = ~Yes... complication is what he does best.~
@663  = ~Ah, I was wondering. He used to be... flashier in his idiotic schemes.~
@664  = ~If you expect me to stand by in silence when Cyric himself stops by for a chat... well.~
@665  = ~I should probably avoid further blasphemy. As it is, he's almost certainly still listening.~
@666  = ~Regardless, I should probably avoid further blasphemy. As it is, he's almost certainly still listening.~
@667  = ~And the final test, finished. All that's left... well, we both know what's left. Do we at least have a moment to spare?~
@668  = ~We have more than a moment. I'm not ready to challenge Melissan just yet.~
@669  = ~Make it brief. This isn't the time for talk.~
@670  = ~We have as long as you need.~
@671  = ~There will be time to talk on the other side. I swear it.~
@672  = ~No, but... she won't wait forever. We'll have to face her soon enough.~
@673  = ~No, it isn't, but... there may not be time later.~
@674  = ~As long as I need. Ha. I would happily wait an age or two before meeting Melissan, but... we'll have to face her soon enough.~
@675  = ~I hope so. Your confidence has seen us through thus far, so... I'll try to believe it.~
@676  = ~With everything coming to a head now... I don't like to leave things unspoken, <CHARNAME>, but it would take a lifetime to go through all of the things I'd like to say.~
@677  = ~People always say that sometimes silence speaks louder than words.~
@678  = ~If I wanted an open book, I would have looked elsewhere. You don't need to say anything.~
@679  = ~It only takes three words, you know.~
@680  = ~Darling, the things you've left unsaid could fill an encyclopedia.~
@681  = ~We don't have a lifetime at the moment, but you could try to make the next five minutes count for something.~
@682  = ~For once I'm glad to hear it.~
@683  = ~My love, I'm sure I've said them once or twice.~
@684  = ~Five minutes. I suppose it'll have to be enough.~
@685  = ~I'm sorry for that. Perhaps there will be a chance to set that right someday.~
@686  = ~You know, I never really wanted glory before... for my name to be on everybody's lips. I was taught to operate from the shadows, even if I wasn't particularly good at it in the end, but this... to be remembered with you...~
@687  = ~It'll be a nice tale to replace my old songs, no matter what the bards have to say about us.~
@688  = ~The stories will be positive. When you do well by people, they remember you for it.~
@689  = ~People can say what they want. We know what was really important.~
@690  = ~So you wait until the very end of things to turn romantic on me?~
@691  = ~"A nice tale?" I can only think of one thing in the past few months that has been nice.~
@692  = ~My love, they'll sing whatever I write for them.~
@693  = ~You really have been listening to Volo too much, haven't you?~
@694  = ~I didn't realize you cared what anyone had to say about you.~
@695  = ~If it really matters to you, then for once, I won't bother arguing it. Hmm.~
@696  = ~True enough, and this was. Rather, this *is*. Hmm.~
@697  = ~I dare say it doesn't really matter at this point. Hmm.~
@698  = ~(smile) No, we've been to the hells and back... quite literally, and you... I know full well what you've been through. Hmm.~
@699  = ~Ha! My dear, I should have expected as much. I never much cared for minstrels before meeting you, but... hmm.~
@700  = ~Very funny. Still... you may be right. Hmm.~
@701  = ~My dear, I tend to like it when people say what I want them to say. Hmm.~
@702  = ~I think our moment of peace is almost over, but if you could just sit here a while longer, <CHARNAME>... I think I'd like to capture this instant, brief though it may be.~
@703  = ~A memento to cling to in the face of eternity, if nothing else. And I know it may very well yet come to that.~
@704  = ~Just... stay here a moment, and then... then we can face tomorrow.~
@705  = ~If you were really so bored, you could have just told me.~
@706  = ~I take it I'm not quite dark and dangerous enough for you anymore? If you'd now rather bed an old enemy instead... well, so be it.~
@707  = ~You... no. I don't believe this. Whatever you think you owe that vapid elven queen, you can't let this... this *thing* travel with us.~
@708  = ~Can't I? It's about more than Ellesime now. Ilmater is involved.~
@709  = ~You saw what was at stake. Would you rather let Cyric get his hands on Irenicus?~
@710  = ~I know how angry you still are over everything. Facing it may just give you closure.~
@711  = ~I can't exactly let him go, though, can I?~
@712  = ~As if I give a damn what whimsies move the Broken God.~
@713  = ~This is bigger than you or I. You don't have to like it, but you do have to accept the necessity.~
@714  = ~You're not going to be reasonable about this, are you?~
@715  = ~If you won't accept this... then he has to die again. Right now.~
@716  = ~Don't you dare try to manipulate me, <CHARNAME>.~
@717  = ~Killing it again would give me greater closure. Preferably right now, but I'll settle for a couple of misplaced spells later if I have to.~
@718  = ~I don't recall saying anything about letting it go.~
@719  = ~That easy, then? Fine. Do whatever the hells you want.~
@720  = ~Unreasonable, am I? Fine. Do whatever the hells you want.~
@721  = ~Heh. I didn't realize there was any such thing as a humble wizard.~
@722  = ~By all the gods, can't these mad dogs *stay* in the Underdark for once?~
@723  = ~But don't expect him to do anything more than that.~
@724  = ~Hmph. Child, perhaps you should consider yourself lucky to still find allies at all.~
@725  = ~Certainly not all wizards.~
@726  = ~So the idiot makes a bargain he isn't prepared to honor? I shouldn't be surprised.~
@727  = ~Too compassionate to bother hiding the deed afterwards as well, no doubt.~
@728  = ~Hells, will someone finally just shove a knife through this bastard's throat?~
@729  = ~I have several myself... though they're increasingly unpleasant.~
@730  = ~Now, now. There's no need for that. Now, <CHARNAME>, might we talk?~
@731  = ~By the gods, could this conversation get any more ludicrous?~
@732  = ~And one can only hope that the dragon will be too grateful to try to eat us herself.~
@733  = ~I can make no promises, but I do not expect her to react violently.~
@734  = ~And here I didn't think my opinion of Bhaalists could sink much lower... what a day for surprises.~
@735  = ~I suppose we should have seen this coming. Best get that wretched heart of hers back again as quickly as possible.~
@736  = ~And nobody lies quite as well as a delusional gnome. You were annoying enough before you decided to branch out into blasphemy, Jan. You're lucky I don't care for holy vengeance these days.~
@737  = ~Lighten up, Annie. I never said it was your people. I'm sure they were quite happy with the real thing, but your more rustic cousins ended up with me instead.~
@738  = ~Don't be so grim, Keldorn. The mud will wash off your armor eventually.~
@739  = ~So far, you're failing spectacularly at that.~
@740  = ~Beautiful. Please tell me we're going to lend these fine men a hand.~
@741  = ~By the gods, I already want to kill him.~
@742  = ~You'd think that their women were incapable of defending themselves.~
@743  = ~If you're so keen to keep your own company, I'm sure we could find *someone* willing to toss you over the city walls.~
@744  = ~Pfeh! And now I have to endure veiled death threats as well?~
@745  = ~Oh, I like this one already.~
@746  = ~Another city under seige... I suppose it's too much to hope that this Yaga Shura is a mere disgruntled lordling.~
@747  = ~I am afraid not.~
@748  = ~Hope? Spare us your tired platitudes, woman. Hope isn't worth much of anything at all against something like this.~
@749  = ~If you had any sense, you wouldn't feel pity for him at all, priestess.~
@750  = ~It certainly seems more comfortable than staying around to be slaughtered.~
@751  = ~Tell me about Adrian.~
@752  = ~Ah, yes... Adrian Vasiliev, formerly of Zhentil Keep, has grown into one of the most powerful mages that his city has produced. The Realms may yet be grateful that he has put his dark home behind him.~
@753  = ~And for love, as strange as it might seem. We can expect that the songs written for him and <CHARNAME> will far outnumber the less pleasant ones sung about him in the past.~
@754  = ~Be that as it may, toss those names around, bard, and it'll be a race to see who finds you first.~
@755  = ~This is absolutely insane.~
@756  = ~By all the gods, the bastard must be insane.~
@757  = ~Mad *and* stupid. I don't think there's a more dangerous combination on a wizard.~
@758  = ~A poetic devil... I can't say this is something I ever wanted to see at all.~
@759  = ~This would be the proverbial wager with a devil, I take it?~
@760  = ~I share no kinship with such horrid beasts, but you are otherwise not far wrong.~
@761  = ~As much as I enjoy the irony, bargaining with this thing doesn't seem that wise.~
@762  = ~And the knights are no doubt completely useless.~
@763  = ~What of the inevitable pain you must give to the one you love? The mage you name Adrian?~
@764  = ~You're a fool if you think I have anything left to fear, Harper.~
@765  = ~Adrian? It shouldn't surprise me to find you still breathing.~
@766  = ~I... you're dead. This... this isn't real.~
@767  = ~It is as real as it needs to be, nephew. What is true and what is false is inconsequential, mere facts to use as one wishes--~
@768  = ~...it is what one believes that matters. I... remember.~
@769  = ~And you repaid my lessons by abandoning me. When the Cormyrian knights closed in around me, you fled. You did not even stay to watch them tear me to pieces, did you?~
@770  = ~I... what could I have done?! I'd only mastered the most basic of spells, I couldn't--~
@771  = ~You were advanced enough to charm commoners and throw them at the paladins, if nothing else.~
@772  = ~Had you made any attempt to distract them, Adrian, I might have stood a chance. But instead, you ran. You might as well have murdered me yourself.~
@773  = ~No... no, I--~
@774  = ~My father was right about you, boy. You should have been sold into slavery as soon as my dear sister brought you home. Had I not argued against it, I would still be alive.~
@775  = ~That's... that's not... <CHARNAME>, make it go away!~
@776  = ~You made your own choices! He isn't responsible for what happened to you!~
@777  = ~Stop it, Gorion! This isn't right!~
@778  = ~Enough! I won't let this continue!~
@779  = ~Don't listen to it, Adrian! It isn't real!~
@780  = ~<CHARNAME>, as much as I want you to stay... this is your decision, not mine. I don't want to hold you here if you've decided you want... more.~
@781  = ~Do you think I should accept it now?~
@782  = ~I still don't want to lose you, Adrian.~
@783  = ~The power that the Solar is offering me... I do suddenly want it.~
@784  = ~No, I don't, but... I don't want you to stay simply because of me.~
@785  = ~Nor I you, but... I don't want you to stay simply because of me.~
@786  = ~I know. I... thought you might. And I don't want you to stay simply because of me.~
@787  = ~If your heart isn't behind it entirely, if you're not completely committed to mortality... I don't want to watch as your doubts tear you apart... tear us apart.~
@788  = ~And there are worse ways for a relationship to end than with one partner ascending to godhood. Heavens know, I've as much experience with that as anyone. I would miss you, <CHARNAME>, but I would survive. I always have before.~
@789  = ~It... isn't an opportunity to reject lightly, <CHARNAME>, though godhood seldom seems to do its recipients any great favor. Whatever decision you make... don't regret it.~
@790  = ~So this is it. I would tell you that this isn't an opportunity to reject lightly, but I dare say the offer speaks for itself.~
@791  = ~Then... this is farewell. Good luck, <CHARNAME>, though I pray you won't need it.~
@792  = ~You... you're sure?~
@793  = ~Shut your mouth, Adrian. You look like a fish.~
@794  = ~I want to be with you. Is that so hard to believe?~
@795  = ~I'd better be sure. I can't take it back now.~
@796  = ~I'm... feeling a bit like one too right now.~
@797  = ~You've... put me to shame, <CHARNAME>.~
@798  = ~And I don't intend to let you regret it, <CHARNAME>.~
@799  = ~(smile) Enough of this, my love. We have the rest of our lives to make sense of things. I think that Solar still wants you.~
@800  = ~(It is no wonder that Adrian's attention is again focused upon you.)~

@803  = ~(Adrian wraps an arm around your shoulders and draws you close. A long moment later, it is only with reluctance that he lets you go.)~
@804  = ~So much blasted desert, <CHARNAME>... I wonder just how much you'd let me get away with if I blamed it on delirium.~
@805  = ~(As you look over the group, you find Adrian watching you, his gaze thoughtful and somewhat concerned. He shakes his head and smiles when your eyes meet.)~
@806  = ~A pity there are so few exotic supplies for sale in this madhouse of a country. I'd meant to buy you some of those exquisite Calishite perfumes back in Athkatla but... never quite got around to it.~
@807  = ~(Adrian draws close to you, unconsciously taking your hand. He looks down a moment later, finally noticing, and laughs softly to himself.)~
@808  = ~(He doesn't let go.)~
@809  = ~This far south, my dear, perhaps you ought to consider a bit less clothing. Surely we could find *something* more appropriate.~
@810  = ~Shall I give you the same advice?~
@811  = ~You'd like that, wouldn't you?~
@812  = ~We do have a task to focus on, Adrian.~
@813  = ~Well, we could both strip down to nothing right here and now, but I suppose that would be at least somewhat unseemly.~

@815  = ~(smile) Well, perhaps not quite.~
@816  = ~Ever so solemn, <CHARNAME>. Well, as you wish.~
@817  = ~(One hand lands on your shoulder, the other tangling gently in your hair.)~

@863  = ~That's probably because you think too much.~
@864  = ~There's nothing wrong with nursing past grievances.~

@867  = ~Hopefully it happens soon. You need to stay focused.~
@868  = ~That could very well be true.~

@879  = ~If that's what you want, then I won't ask.~
@880  = ~It comes down to the same thing in the end, though, doesn't it? He... you know, I can't even say he taught me well, the years of Zhentarim propaganda notwithstanding. He cared about me in his own way, I think, but he was subtle. Very, very subtle.~
@881  = ~I doubt that, but I don't think you'll leave me alone about it if I don't.  He... you know, I can't even say he taught me well, the years of Zhentarim propaganda notwithstanding. He cared about me in his own way, I think, but he was subtle. Very, very subtle.~
@882  = ~Apparently you won't leave me alone about it until I do.  He... you know, I can't even say he taught me well, the years of Zhentarim propaganda notwithstanding. He cared about me in his own way, I think, but he was subtle. Very, very subtle.~
@883  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@884  = ~More so than I ever was, perhaps. I... honestly can't say that he would have been glad I escaped if it meant his death.~
@885  = ~If he really cared about you at all, he would have been.~
@886  = ~He doesn't sound like he was worth caring for at all.~
@887  = ~He didn't die because of you, you know.~
@888  = ~Don't put that Wraith's words in his mouth, Adrian.~
@889  = ~Hmm. Perhaps.~
@890  = ~Just another cunning Zhent bastard, is it?~
@891  = ~No... no. And I don't think he ever would have.~
@892  = ~I... honestly wish I were.~
@893  = ~I still love him... as much as I can love anyone who's been dead for a decade and a half. He treated me better than he might have. Better than most masters do.~
@894  = ~I... only wish that my memory of him weren't twisted now by the things that creature said, though... there's nothing to be done about that.~
@895  = ~What happened there... it wasn't your fault, <CHARNAME>. You have to understand that.~
@896  = ~But he was looking for me.~
@897  = ~Tell that to the dead. They would certainly have thought so.~
@898  = ~That doesn't change what we saw.~
@899  = ~This is just more of the same for you, isn't it?~
@900  = ~I should have been there... we could have stopped him.~
@901  = ~Hmm. We're no strangers to terrible things, but that was a bit... excessive.~
@902  = ~That's all you can say? What is this, just more of the same to you?~
@903  = ~I wish Gorion had bothered to teach me even half as much as Nyalee taught Yaga-Shura.~
@904  = ~Pity I don't seem capable of raising a decent army of my own. Everyone else seems to have one.~
@905  = ~Regardless, that doesn't shift the blame. You have enough to worry about without martyring yourself over your siblings' crimes as well.~
@906  = ~No... no, it doesn't.~
@907  = ~It's... nothing I haven't seen before. But come. There's still work to be done to<DAYNIGHT>.~
@908  = ~Perhaps, perhaps not. Regardless, that doesn't shift the blame. You have enough to worry about without martyring yourself over your siblings' crimes as well.~
@909  = ~Heh. I can sympathize with the sentiment, <CHARNAME>, but I for one am glad you still have your heart.~
@910  = ~Heh. An army would just get in our way, I think.~
@911  = ~I suppose that depends. Why do you ask?~
@912  = ~I was wondering if you would want some one day.~
@913  = ~Because I'd like to have yours someday.~
@914  = ~I wanted to make sure you knew I didn't want any.~
@915  = ~I haven't really given it much thought recently. A decade ago, I'd always planned to, but now... I don't know. There's quite the history of bad parenting in my family. I'd hate to perpetuate it.~
@916  = ~You care. If anything, that means that you'll be a great father.~
@917  = ~Don't be ridiculous. If we can get through this, we can survive anything.~
@918  = ~If you're not comfortable with it, we certainly don't have to.~
@919  = ~And then when we throw my heritage into the mix... no, I suppose that isn't a very good idea.~
@920  = ~I... see. I don't know, <CHARNAME>. I... well, there's quite the history of bad parenting in my family. I'd hate to perpetuate it.~
@921  = ~They do seem to be more trouble than they're worth, and I... well, there's quite the history of bad parenting in my family. I'd hate to perpetuate it.~
@922  = ~Well... perhaps we could have one. If things ever settle down for us. I doubt that it's going to be an option anytime soon, though.~
@923  = ~Then I'm glad we're agreed. Honestly, my love, they do seem to be more trouble than they're worth.~
@924  = ~Mmm. I think I would like that as well. We'll talk about it tonight, my dear.~
@925  = ~(Once you settle down for the night, Adrian draws you into his arms and begins to massage the tension out of your shoulders.)~
@926  = ~(A moment before it might seem that this is all he has on his mind, you feel his lips brush against your ear.)~
@927  = ~You haven't changed your mind, I assume?~
@928  = ~And if I have?~
@929  = ~I've never actually done this before.~
@930  = ~I think I've waited long enough as it is.~
@931  = ~You're not into anything weird, are you?~
@932  = ~(turn around and kiss him)~
@933  = ~I know I said I wanted this, but it's been a long <DAYNIGHT>.~
@934  = ~(sigh) You're quite the tease, aren't you, <CHARNAME>? Well, if you'd rather we wait, I won't complain. Overly. Let's just go to sleep, then.~
@935  = ~If it makes you feel better, I haven't done it in quite some time myself.~
@936  = ~I'm not going to hurt you, <CHARNAME>. If you'd like to wait, I can accept that. And if you'd rather... hmm, build up to it, that's perfectly acceptable as well.~
@937  = ~No, I'm ready. Just be careful.~
@938  = ~I like that second option.~
@939  = ~I'm not worried about me. You, however, had best perform.~
@940  = ~I would rather wait.~
@941  = ~Then we needn't wait any longer.~
@942  = ~Nothing particularly so. You don't need to worry about it.~
@943  = ~Interesting. I'll have to remember that. (kiss him)~
@944  = ~On the contrary, I was very much hoping that the answer would be yes.~
@945  = ~I'm not worried. I prefer a man who can take a bit of punishment.~
@946  = ~I see. I know I said I wanted this, but it's been a long <DAYNIGHT>.~
@947  = ~(He returns your kiss eagerly, his hands drifting downward to caress your body through your clothing.)~
@948  = ~Ah. I suppose it has. Let's just go to sleep, then.~
@949  = ~If you don't like anything, <CHARNAME>, just tell me.~
@950  = ~(smile) I'll have to keep that in mind, then.~
@951  = ~Whenever you're ready, just tell me.~
@952  = ~Hmm. I see.~
@953  = ~What shall I do with you, my love? I try not to misuse magic, but this once...~

@1104 = ~(Adrian jumps when you suddenly embrace him from behind, and the words of defensive spell die on his lips. He reaches out, awkwardly patting your arm.)~
@1105 = ~(Sighing softly, he rests his hands awkwardly on your waist.)~
@1106 = ~<CHARNAME>, stop it. Please.~
@1107 = ~(Adrian shrugs his shoulders luxuriously beneath your hands, and it is unclear whether he's enjoying the massage or your presence more.)~
@1108 = ~(As you call a short break, you move over to Adrian, resting your hands on his shoulders to give him one of the massages he so enjoys. He slips free and pulls you into his lap instead, kneading his fingers into your own shoulders.)~
@1109 = ~Mmm, you're quite good at that, <CHARNAME>. Ever considered giving up on adventuring and joining a harem instead, my lady? Though I dare say I'd rather keep you for myself.~
@1110 = ~(The half-elf murmurs softly with pleasure as you massage the knots out of his muscles.)~
@1111 = ~Don't we have places to be and people to kill, my dear?~
@1112 = ~(As soon as you call a halt, Adrian settles unceremoniously on the ground, drags off one of his boots, and angrily fishes a stone out of it. He jumps slightly when your hands land on his shoulders, but slowly relaxes as you massage the tension away.)~
@1113 = ~Mmm, one of the advantages of simply wearing robes.~
@1114 = ~Yes, yes. I already know that I'm tense.~
@1115 = ~(He smiles, loosening his robes enough that you can slip your hands beneath.)~
@1116 = ~(He shuts his eyes for a moment, indulging in the attention.)~
@1117 = ~(He draws you closer and kisses you, clearly enjoying the shameless indulgence.)~
@1118 = ~(He catches your hands, pressing them to his lips for a brief moment before pushing you away with a wry smile.)~
@1119 = ~(Smiling, he catches you by the shoulders and turns you around, holding you close as his own hands roam across your body.)~
@1120 = ~Turnabout, my dear?~
@1121 = ~Mmm, even for me, this is... somewhat exhibitionistic. Could we indulge later, my lady?~
@1122 = ~You shouldn't let me distract you so, my love. We have things to do.~
@1123 = ~(He holds you close as you kiss him, finally pulling away with a reluctant smile.)~
@1124 = ~(His hands travel slowly up the front of your body as you kiss, his fingers brushing lightly against the undersides of your breasts before he withdraws them and pulls away.)~
@1125 = ~Best not to get too carried away, my love.~
@1126 = ~Mmm, if you're hoping to turn me into a fair prince with this... mmm. Never mind.~
@1127 = ~(He's reading through a tome when you approach him, and shakes his head when he realizes your intent, clearly not interested at the moment.)~
@1128 = ~(He shuts his eyes and holds you close, shamelessly indulging in the attention.)~
@1129 = ~Careful, my lady. I don't think we have the time to properly indulge right now.~
@1130 = ~(The kiss is all too short, and he shakes his head afterwards, indicating that this is neither the time nor the place.)~
