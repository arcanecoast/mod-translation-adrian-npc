@3    = ~When asked about his past, ADRIAN smiles slightly and says that there are enough demons to face in the present without worrying about yesterday's as well. Given his recent enslavement, it would appear that he has more than a few of his own with which to contend. Despite his slippery responses, you eventually glean that he spent some time in Sembia, working as a hirespell wizard for a rising merchant prince. You quickly learn that further prodding will win you nothing but headaches.~

@73   = ~The years following Adrian's travels with <CHARNAME> were surprisingly quiet. Finding himself with too many questions and no true answers, he soon gave up adventuring and took up residence near a temple of Azuth in Cimbar. A life of contemplation, however, ultimately proved unsuitable, and he was encouraged to leave the city after a violent clash with a Chessentan nobleman. Shortly after Bane's resurrection and the resurgence of his church, Adrian relocated to Waterdeep. He would claim the two incidents unrelated, but most believed that for his own protection, he had entered into an arrangement with the Blackstaff. While the truth of this is uncertain, Adrian remained well behaved and is believed to have kept his dealings with the Waterdhavian underworld reasonably limited. He never married nor had children of his own, though he eventually chose to take on apprentices. How he found time to teach them whilst embroiled in Waterdhavian intrigue is considered one of Faerun's greatest mysteries.~
@74   = ~The years following Adrian's travels with <CHARNAME> were surprisingly quiet. As she had promised, Jaheira accompanied him to Shadowdale, where he attempted to reconcile with his father. The road was as rocky as could be expected, and after a clash with a local Harper, Adrian was kindly invited to leave. He would remain on good terms with Jaheira in the following years and eventually established a functional relationship with his father, but his opinion of the Dale remained as low as it had ever been.

@75   = ~Adrian's experiences with <CHARNAME> further embittered him. Never a great admirer of elves, he found his fury towards the late Irenicus turning more and more upon the people of Suldanessellar who, in his mind, had created the monster. Adrian wandered the northern lands for a time after his travels with <CHARNAME>, trying without success to alleviate his bitterness. In failure, he finally returned home to the Moonsea, where he truly came into his power. Taking advantage of the recent turmoil within the ranks of the Zhentarim, he lured away a number of members, promising them the wealth of Suldanessellar instead. This ultimately proved to be his undoing, as he would meet his end at the hands of the famous ranger Drizzt Do'Urden, on the very steps of the city he had once helped to save.~
@76   = ~Despite his assurances that he would survive without her, the months following <CHARNAME>'s ascension were surprisingly difficult for Adrian. He quickly fell out of contact with his former companions and soon left the Sword Coast altogether, taking up residence near a temple of Azuth in Cimbar instead.

It was ultimately Cyricists rather than Banites who caught up with Adrian. How they lured so powerful a mage to his death is uncertain, though it is a long established fact that any man can be bested. Their intent, however, was all too clear. When the clerics finally tossed the body onto the steps of <CHARNAME>'s temple, one laughingly claimed, "If that doesn't send a message, I don't know what will."~

Concerned about a community's ability to tolerate a child of Bhaal, Adrian's own difficulties notwithstanding, the couple was reluctant to finally settle down in any one place.

Despite the increasingly wild rumors, <CHARNAME> and Adrian enjoyed life in the City of Splendors. They never had children of their own, though Adrian eventually did choose to take on apprentices.
