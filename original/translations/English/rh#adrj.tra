@1    = ~I'm grabbing a table in the back corner over there. You're welcome to join me, if you'd like.~
@2    = ~I did intend to celebrate our escape, and this is as good a way as any.~
@3    = ~The back corner? Can't you at least choose a table with a bit more light and a few less rats?~
@4    = ~By the looks of this place, I think you won't be getting your decent glass of wine just yet. Nor am I taking you to every tavern in the city.~
@5    = ~I'm way ahead of you. I've already bought every vintage in the inn. Calishite, Tethyrian, Chessentan... there's this local Amnish ale if you'd like something more bitter.~
@6    = ~You're not going to get drunk and accidentally turn us all into mice or something, are you?~
@7    = ~We don't have time for this nonsense, Adrian. We need to find Imoen and Irenicus.~
@8    = ~I'd prefer dancing on Irenicus' grave, but I doubt we're going to get to do that anytime soon.~
@9    = ~Yes, let's take a table in the middle of the room with potential cutthroats all around. A brilliant plan, <CHARNAME>.~
@10   = ~I don't see why not. It's one of the better ways of acquiring information, especially in situations such as this.~
@11   = ~Keep it. I've had enough of bitter for the moment.~
@12   = ~What? No. I've always been more of an enchanter and a pyromaniac than a transmuter anyway.~
@13   = ~Relax, <CHARNAME>. I'm not going to burn the tavern down... as much as I might want to.~
@14   = ~One <DAYNIGHT> is hardly going to make a difference. With any luck, they'll still be in the Cowled Wizard's hands. Are you coming?~
@15   = ~Oh, alright.~
@16   = ~Not a chance.~
@17   = ~Hmm. This Tethyrian vintage is better than I remembered. And... mmm. Perhaps a bit stronger. The setting may leave quite a bit to be desired, but we might as well do this properly.~
@18   = ~A toast, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? To vengeance. Vengeance fitting enough to make the lady Loviatar smile.~
@19   = ~I'll drink to that. We've certainly paid in advance.~
@20   = ~I'd rather not draw the attention of any *more* dark gods, Adrian.~
@21   = ~I'd rather raise a glass for justice, and ask for Tyr's blessing instead.~
@22   = ~And to freedom; may we cling to it better this time than we did before.~
@23   = ~And to the fallen: friends who are lost but never forgotten.~
@24   = ~That's quite enough wine for you. I'm out of here.~
@25   = ~True enough. Well, we'll find the bastard. And your girl. Speaking of which...~
@26   = ~Hmm. Suit yourself. I still want him dead. As for that girl of yours...~
@27   = ~We'll find your girl too. Speaking of which...~
@28   = ~You and she seemed very, ah...~
@29   = ~Close? She's my oldest friend and has been with me through this whole mess. Losing her now...~
@30   = ~Close? She was like a sister to me. If I have to tear the Realms apart to find her again, I will.~
@31   = ~We grew up together, and I've tried to keep her out of trouble so far. Why stop now?~
@32   = ~Dysfunctional? She may be aggravating as can be, but family is still family, and I ought to bail her out.~
@33   = ~Dysfunctional? You don't know the half of it. I'd happily leave the idiotic girl to rot, but I will find Irenicus.~
@34   = ~And on the brink of freedom, no less.~
@35   = ~And I can just imagine the songs the bards would sing: love and destruction, painted in black and white.~
@36   = ~That's admirable, I suppose. When your family is worth the trouble.~
@37   = ~And where one is, the other shall be as well.~
@38   = ~That's fair enough, I suppose.~
@39   = ~I... should thank you, <CHARNAME>. Properly. There are only so many times I can say it before wanting to choke on my own tongue, but... you saved my life. I won't forget that.~
@40   = ~Don't worry about it.~
@41   = ~It's not a big deal. Sometimes people simply need help.~
@42   = ~You needn't thank me at all. It's what anyone would have done.~
@43   = ~I expect you to make it up to me.~
@44   = ~I don't care for your gratitude one way or the other.~
@45   = ~I'm sure I could think of several ways you could repay the favor.~
@46   = ~Regardless, I fully intend to repay the debt. You have my services, at least until the mage and your friend are recovered.~
@47   = ~I fully intend to. You have my services, at least until the mage and your friend are recovered.~
@48   = ~...indeed. Regardless, a promise is a promise. You have my services, at least until the mage and your friend are recovered.~
@49   = ~I'm... sure you could. Regardless, you have my services, at least until the mage and your friend are recovered.~
@50   = ~Enough wine for now, I think. If you'll excuse me, I'd like to look into this wretched place's bathing facilities anyway.~
@51   = ~Right. Well, if you intend to get distracted by every damsel in distress, I do hope you remember that Irenicus and Imoen are still out there.~
@52   = ~You can go back to chasing your windmills and whatever else it is that you do after this mess is resolved.~
@53   = ~I can already tell that you're going to be a delight to have around.~
@54   = ~Hey! There's never been a better season for windmill tilting!~
@55   = ~A damsel in distress, are we now? Well, you look the part, I suppose, but I think next time I'll let the evil wizard keep you.~
@56   = ~I don't see why I can't do both at the same time.~
@57   = ~I came here to share a drink with you, not get insulted for saving your life. I expect at least a modicum of respect.~
@58   = ~I do work at it. If you'll excuse me, I'd like to look into this wretched place's bathing facilities.~
@59   = ~Ha! Fine. Tilt away, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. If you'll excuse me, I'd like to look into this wretched place's bathing facilities.~
@60   = ~Ha! Heavens know, I've never quite had a knight in shining armor before, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, but at least I managed to land one with some wit.~
@61   = ~If you'll excuse me, I think I'd like to look into washing the grime out of my...long black locks, as you put it. Then we can get back to saving all the damsels you want.~
@62   = ~Wonderful. If you'll excuse me, I'd like to look into this wretched place's bathing facilities.~
@63   = ~You have my gratitude, <CHARNAME>. More than that... well, I suppose we'll have to see.~
@64   = ~If you'll excuse me, I think I'd like to look into washing off the grime of several months of imprisonment. Then you can save all the damsels you want.~
@65   = ~You seem to make a habit of attracting powerful attention, <CHARNAME>. Dangerous attention. First Irenicus, now Gaelan Bayle and his shadowy organization. It's quite the talent.~
@66   = ~Does this amuse you?~
@67   = ~What do you think of Gaelan Bayle?~
@68   = ~Any idea who he's working for?~
@69   = ~His shadowy organization... I assume you're thinking what I'm thinking.~
@70   = ~Stick to the magic, Adrian. I'm capable of handling the rest.~
@71   = ~For all of our sakes, and little Imoen's as well, you damn well better be.~
@72   = ~I enjoy a good intrigue. Heavens know, I was raised on the stuff. I haven't much else going for me at the moment, so I'll take what I can get. As for our dear friend Master Bayle...~
@73   = ~It's pretty obvious, I should think.~
@74   = ~Most likely.~
@75   = ~He's a complete idiot.~
@76   = ~There's nothing quite like an incompetent attempt at subterfuge to give yourself away, and nothing screams Shadow Thief like a mindless obsession with secrecy.~
@77   = ~Everyone knows who rules the Amnish underground. His masters, I assume, are considerably more interesting than he himself, but then masters usually are.~
@78   = ~That they would so quickly take an interest in you, <CHARNAME>... that's intriguing.~
@79   = ~What is this, a game to you?~
@80   = ~They want money. 20,000 gold pieces of it, to be specific.~
@81   = ~I'm glad you're happy. This whole thing just frightens me.~
@82   = ~It is kind of fun, isn't it?~
@83   = ~I do hope you can stay focused in the face of such entertainment.~
@84   = ~He's a complete idiot. There's nothing quite like an incompetent attempt at subterfuge to give yourself away, and nothing screams Shadow Thief like a mindless obsession with secrecy.~
@85   = ~I enjoy a good intrigue. Heavens know, I was raised on the stuff. I haven't much else going for me at the moment, so I'll take what I can get. ~
@86   = ~They want money. 20,000 gold pieces of it, to be specific. That's not interesting.~
@87   = ~Good. That caution might keep you alive longer. They may be offering you aid, <CHARNAME>, but never forget that they're not your friends.~
@88   = ~You don't need to patronize me, Adrian. I'm not a child.~
@89   = ~They're certainly charging me enough for it.~
@90   = ~I'll keep that in mind.~
@91   = ~It's hardly about the money. If you had gone to them for help, their price would have probably been twice as high, but nobody in their right mind seeks out penniless adventurers to extort if they need gold in a rush.~
@92   = ~The money is incidental; it's you that they're interested in, <CHARNAME>.~
@93   = ~That actually makes a lot of sense.~
@94   = ~Are you done yet?~
@95   = ~Good. Step carefully and keep your eyes open, don't underestimate or misjudge them, and get used to being used, if you're not already.~
@96   = ~But that's enough of a warning, I think. They've set the music; I suppose it's time to dance.~
@97   = ~As long as you don't lose sight of the fact that it's also deadly dangerous. Step carefully and keep your eyes open, don't underestimate or misjudge them, and get used to being used, if you're not already.~
@98   = ~You needn't worry. I do know what I'm doing, <CHARNAME>. I'm only hoping that you do too. Step carefully and keep your eyes open, don't underestimate or misjudge them, and get used to being used, if you're not already.~
@99   = ~If you're not interested in accepting advice, I damn well hope you're capable of handling this on your own.~
@100  = ~Hells, I never realized how irritating it would be simply to be forced to wander around looking for work like this. Can't we simply... I don't know, blackmail wealthy Amnish noblemen instead?~
@101  = ~I take it you don't normally work?~
@102  = ~I'm sure the Shadow Thieves would love that.~
@103  = ~That's disgusting.~
@104  = ~I'm not interested in listening to you complain.~
@105  = ~Fine. Listen to the sound of your own plodding footsteps then, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@106  = ~I don't normally *look* for work. Heavens know, I'm more accustomed to simply being told what to do.~
@107  = ~And somehow that's preferable?~
@108  = ~Yes, the horror of being forced to think for oneself.~
@109  = ~Technically, you're still being told what to do. By me.~
@110  = ~It depended upon the assignment. Sometimes it was, sometimes it wasn't... but it was seldom anything like this.~
@111  = ~Oh, I assure you, the two aren't mutually exclusive if the work in question is interesting enough.  This hardly qualifies.~
@112  = ~Yes... and I'm afraid it loses some of the mystique when I still get to watch you wander around aimlessly.~
@113  = ~You're right. If we have to perform for them as it is, I suppose it's best to play things as straight as possible. I would rather not look like a liability.~
@114  = ~Play things too straight, and they might just grow bored with us.~
@115  = ~We're going to be "playing things straight" because that's simply the way I prefer to work.~
@116  = ~Yes, I'm sure you'd rather wait until it's too late to get rid of you to show just how much of a liability you are.~
@117  = ~Mmm, I'm likely to grow bored myself long before they are.~
@118  = ~Indeed. You needn't worry, I'll behave. I won't promise to be happy about it, though.~
@119  = ~How very clever, <CHARNAME>. No, I have no intention of wandering off and doing something stupid.  Well, stupider than being involved in this in the first place.~
@120  = ~Is it? You might want to rethink this potential alliance with the Shadow Thieves, then. Or quite possibly give up entirely and run off to Silverymoon or Cormyr instead. They might almost be noble enough for you.~
@121  = ~I may accept help wherever I can find it, but that doesn't mean I have to sink to their level.~
@122  = ~What's wrong with Silverymoon and Cormyr? They seem like lovely places.~
@123  = ~That certainly sounds better than enduring your continued company.~
@124  = ~Guilt by association doesn't count, does it? I'll have to remember that.~
@125  = ~Listen to me... I didn't mean to start fighting with you, <CHARNAME>, but this... well.~
@126  = ~Indeed. There are plenty of dragons left to slay there. Especially in Cormyr. Though I doubt you would be as interested in the purple variety.~
@127  = ~I can't say that I've ever really understood it. "Adventuring." Who coined that term anyway, I wonder? It almost sounds like something out of a children's book... which could explain why so many so-called adventurers are so young in oh, so very many ways.~
@128  = ~I happen to be an adventurer, I hope you realize.~
@129  = ~Using the word "so" that many times has to be illegal in some countries.~
@130  = ~The lure of the road and the promise of freedom and glory... it can be very appealing.~
@131  = ~Is it conspiracy theory time? Some evil organization long ago came up with the term "adventurer" in an attempt to lure as many of the Realms' youth as possible to an untimely death?~
@132  = ~You may be adventuring, but I'm not altogether sure I'd consider you an adventurer, per se. You're a bit less... wide-eyed and idiotic than I would expect. At least, I hope you are.~
@133  = ~Some parts of Thay, perhaps. I don't doubt there's some Red Wizard somewhere who changes the rules in his small corner of the world daily simply as a social experiment to see how the poor, terrified commoners react. A sight to see if a visit to Thay weren't largely suicidal.~
@134  = ~Though with any luck, our journeys won't lead us quite that far afield. Amn is unpleasant enough, though under any other circumstances... hmm.  You seem rather comfortable with it, though.~
@135  = ~The illusion of freedom, a moment's glory, and then a forgotten grave in the middle of some monster's lair. At least it's a shining example of the weak and stupid weeding themselves out of society. More for the rest of us to fight over.~
@136  = ~You seem rather comfortable with the concept, though, the circumstances notwithstanding.~
@137  = ~Mmm, it makes slightly more sense than world conquest through dracolichs, doesn't it? Still, if there is a conspiracy going on, it's more likely some vapid do-gooders deciding that manipulating children into doing their work for them is in everyone's best interests.~
@138  = ~I really do hope this wasn't your first career choice, <CHARNAME>. It certainly leaves a lot to be desired.~
@139  = ~Hardly. I'd hoped to use my treasure to buy a dukedom up north. After this, perhaps I still will.~
@140  = ~I don't care about adventuring. It's the promise of violence that draws me to this path.~
@141  = ~What's wrong with it? I've always wanted to see as much as the world as possible.~
@142  = ~I really would rather spend my life doing something worthwhile, as silly as that might seem to you.~
@143  = ~I'd have happily settled down in Baldur's Gate if not for Irenicus.~
@144  = ~Your past adventures must have been quite lucrative. I know for a fact that titles tend to be quite expensive... though I won't fault you the ambition.~
@145  = ~How delightfully crass of you. I honestly don't know why I even bother sometimes.~
@146  = ~It isn't as interesting as you think it is. Eventually you'll come to find that the places in between aren't as different or exciting as you'd hoped they'd be.~
@147  = ~Silly, suicidal... take your pick. We'll see how many of the people you saved will even remember your name afterwards.~
@148  = ~Hmm. I've never been there before, or any of the major cities along the Sword Coast, for that matter. I'd always hoped to get to Waterdeep, though it never happened and probably never will.~
@149  = ~But I've taken up enough time complaining. We'd best get back to... whatever it is that we're supposed to be doing.~
@150  = ~Hero of the Sword Coast... hmm. You're not really what I expected, though I suppose such people tend to be somewhat... difficult to predict.~
@151  = ~I'd picked up a bit about the Iron Crisis -- it's hard not to while running caravans -- though not nearly as much as I'd have liked.~
@152  = ~I keep on hearing whispers about the Iron Throne and about Bhaal, though... two things that don't normally go together, as far as I'm aware.~
@153  = ~Running caravans, is it? You didn't really strike me as the merchant type.~
@154  = ~You're familiar with the Iron Throne? Aren't they supposed to be a secret organization?~
@155  = ~What were you expecting me to look like?~
@156  = ~You have terrible timing, Adrian. Could we talk about this later?~
@157  = ~It's a long and unpleasant story, and not one I'm interested in sharing. Suffice to say, it was as tedious as it sounds.~
@158  = ~Familiar... no, not quite. I spent some of my time in Sembia trying to learn more about them some five years back, but I can't say I have much to show for it. Despite my best efforts.~
@159  = ~A bit more... draconic, perhaps. Twenty feet tall, breathing fire. Perhaps one of those annoying metallic ones. Stopping wars, slaying despots... they tend to enjoy that sort of thing.~
@160  = ~But you haven't answered the... well, I suppose I didn't quite phrase it as a question. What exactly was going on up north?~
@161  = ~Sarevok, Rieltar's foster son, was a child of Bhaal. He hijacked his father's war against Amn and tried to ascend to godhood. Obviously he failed.~
@162  = ~I killed the leaders of the Iron Throne and then I killed Sarevok, a son of Bhaal who was trying to become a god.~
@163  = ~Sarevok, a son of Bhaal, murdered the leaders of the Iron Throne before trying to slaughter the rest of the Sword Coast. He was trying to achieve godhood, and I had to stop him.~
@164  = ~I haven't answered the question, nor do I intend to.~
@165  = ~Ahh. That's... not quite what I was expecting. It seems like everyone wants to rule the heavens this year.~
@166  = ~Shall I assume, then, that the other rumor is true as well? That you're a <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of Bhaal yourself?~
@167  = ~That was more forward than I'm used to.~
@168  = ~And if I am? Does that bother you?~
@169  = ~It isn't.~
@170  = ~Where in the hells did you hear that?~
@171  = ~It really isn't any of your business.~
@172  = ~I keep my ears open, <CHARNAME>. I always have.~
@173  = ~There's a fine line sometimes between subtlety and diffidence, <CHARNAME>. I... try not to cross it.~
@174  = ~I... haven't really decided yet.~
@175  = ~No? If you hope to keep a secret like that from the people who travel with you, you're more of a fool than I thought.~
@176  = ~You lie beautifully, <CHARNAME>, but I wouldn't have brought it up if I weren't already convinced it was true.~
@177  = ~Really? Try that in front of a mirror a few times and you might start to sound convincing.~
@178  = ~A child of Bhaal. That's... quite the legacy, though I'm sure I don't need to tell you that. How long have you known?~
@179  = ~Why would you assume that I haven't always known?~
@180  = ~I think I always guessed that something was different about me.~
@181  = ~I only found out recently. Within the past year.~
@182  = ~If Sarevok hadn't tried to kill me last year, I probably still wouldn't know.~
@183  = ~This conversation is over. I'm not talking about Bhaal.~
@184  = ~A child of Bhaal. I suppose that explains why you don't seem quite so... hopelessly elven. How long have you known?~
@185  = ~Hopelessly elven? Don't think you're getting away with that.~
@186  = ~Oh? I dare say that's the more interesting half of your heritage speaking now, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@187  = ~I doubt even the <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of a god is born with the full knowledge of <PRO_HISHER> paternity.~
@188  = ~I'd have settled for a far lesser distinction than that, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. In fact, I did.~
@189  = ~That's... unfortunate. A year hardly seems like enough time to process something of that magnitude.~
@190  = ~Indeed.~
@191  = ~Still, the cards are what they are, I suppose.~
@192  = ~Tell me about it. I'm getting tired of all of the death and chaos that constantly follows me.~
@193  = ~At least I'll never be bored.~
@194  = ~I have the blood of a god in me. One day I may still get the chance to throw these cards back in the dealer's face.~
@195  = ~And as much as I may not care for the hand I've been dealt, I intend to win with it all the same.~
@196  = ~Are they? My destiny is my own, and to the hells with the rest of it.~
@197  = ~Well, I don't think you can expect it to go away anytime soon, all things considered. But enough of this... Irenicus certainly won't chase himself.~
@198  = ~I suppose that's something. But enough of this... Irenicus certainly can't be expected to chase himself.~
@199  = ~Mighty <CHARNAME>, running <PRO_HISHER> sword through the heart of mad Cyric himself. Mmm, what a sight that would be.~
@200  = ~A sentiment to live by, even if following them can prove more difficult than saying them. But enough of this... Irenicus certainly can't be expected to chase himself.~
@201  = ~You're either brilliant or mad, <CHARNAME>. I guess time will tell which.~
@202  = ~I see.~
@203  = ~C-could you spare a c-couple of coins?~
@204  = ~Here. Five gold. Buy yourself a dagger and go teach yourself how to cut purses if you hope to survive the year. And stop stuttering.~
@205  = ~Y-yes, sir! Thank you, sir.~
@206  = ~What? It was just five gold. I'll never miss it.~
@207  = ~I hope you remember that later tonight when you start looking for wine.~
@208  = ~I'm not complaining. But...why?~
@209  = ~Fine. I'll charm it out of some drunken fool. Honestly, <CHARNAME>, am I not allowed to give a damn every once in a while?~
@210  = ~Her father was likely some self-impressed elven wanderer who couldn't be bothered to stay around, and her idiot mother probably drank herself to death rather than deal with the consequences. Scum, but it isn't the girl's fault.~
@211  = ~Is that what happened to you?~
@212  = ~Soft spot for half-elves? I'll have to take note of that.~
@213  = ~No. It isn't. But I did spend about a week on the street myself as a child. In a far worse city than Athkatla.~
@214  = ~Only the young ones. I once spent about a week on the street myself as a child. In a far worse city than Athkatla.~
@215  = ~I had run away from home once for some slight or another. I knew to stay away from the orphanages... they tend to be slaving fronts back home, but I ended up getting picked up by slavers all the same. It was... memorable, at least.~
@216  = ~That was unbelievably stupid of you.~
@217  = ~How did you get away?~
@218  = ~Memorable? That sounds horrible.~
@219  = ~Slaving fronts? Where in the hells do you come from? Thay?~
@220  = ~Yes, it was.~
@221  = ~Well, my family sorted it out in the end.~
@222  = ~Close enough.~
@223  = ~But your background must be significantly more interesting than my own, <CHARNAME>. I imagine it's safe to assume that Bhaal didn't raise you. You lack the certain... sociopathic edge that one would expect.~
@224  = ~Heavens forbid! No, I was raised in Candlekeep.~
@225  = ~As interesting as that would have been, I actually come from Candlekeep.~
@226  = ~I'd rather not speak of it.~
@227  = ~Why ever would you assume that? I've inherited my dear father's strength, his bloodlust, not to mention his absolutely charming way with people. Why, just the other day someone pointed out how uncanny the resemblance was. Right before I killed him in a ritualistic sacrifice, that is.~
@228  = ~Ha! Well, you've obviously picked up your sharp wit from another source.~
@229  = ~I meant every word I said.~
@230  = ~Though where exactly, we'll never know. I actually come from Candlekeep.~
@231  = ~The monks in Candelkeep, no doubt. Or perhaps Imoen.~
@232  = ~Well, then. Forget I said anything at all.~
@233  = ~You're a <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of Bhaal, <CHARNAME>. I doubt your background could get any darker. If it did, I assure you, I'd be more impressed than horrified.~
@234  = ~Oh, fine. I was actually raised in Candlekeep.~
@235  = ~Darker? Sometimes people don't want to talk about things because they're too painful, not because the truth is shady.~
@236  = ~I just said I don't want to talk.~
@237  = ~Painful? What are you, some whimpering child? If you can't face your past, I look forward to seeing how you plan on facing your future.~
@238  = ~I don't remember asking you for your opinion, Adrian, and I never said I couldn't face it. If you must know, I was raised in Candlekeep.~
@239  = ~That's rich, coming from you. If it means that much to you, I come from Candlekeep.~
@240  = ~Good job. Now I'm even less interested in talking.~
@241  = ~Candlekeep? The dusty old library over the Sea of Swords? That must have been exceedingly dull.~
@242  = ~Dull is one way to put it. Unbearable would be a better one. Gorion...~
@243  = ~It seemed dull at the time, and nondescript now, but Gorion taught me well. Childhood is about preparation, not excitement, and mine could have been much worse. Especially given my heritage.~
@244  = ~And how! Nothing but books, all around. I left as soon as I could.~
@245  = ~Dull? I wouldn't say so. If anything, I miss the peace of it.~
@246  = ~If only. The trouble Imoen could get up to...~
@247  = ~Oh, I found many ways to liven it up. Much to the dismay of my guardian, Gorion...~
@248  = ~Did the moldering books raise you, then?~
@249  = ~Not funny. No, a sage called Gorion fostered me.~
@250  = ~Close enough. A sage called Gorion fostered me.~
@251  = ~I'd rather not talk about it.~
@252  = ~Gorion? The Harper?~
@253  = ~Yes. Did you know him?~
@254  = ~The very same.~
@255  = ~Only by reputation.~
@256  = ~I can only imagine what was it like to be raised by One Who Harps... on and on and on.~
@257  = ~I presume it was full of constant moralizing, suspect ideology, and a stress on freedom remarkably at odds with your own lack thereof.~
@258  = ~Your sarcasm is unwarranted. Gorion was a good man, if a bit overbearing. He meant well, and he deserved better than what happened to him.~
@259  = ~I will not have you speak of him thus! I might not have understood it at the time, but every lesson he imparted upon me was done so that I would be better equipped to fight Bhaal's legacy. He was a great man, and you will give him the respect he deserves.~
@260  = ~That's a horrible thing to say! I would prefer to live in a world where people cared enough to fight for what was right, rather than in one drowning in endless cynicism.~
@261  = ~Wow, you really hate Harpers, don't you?~
@262  = ~By the gods, you have no idea. Not that the lessons took very well.~
@263  = ~I suppose. I was too busy playing tricks on the librarians to pay attention.~
@264  = ~It's all a bit of a haze, really. A very, very boring haze.~
@265  = ~Dare I ask what became of him?~
@266  = ~Sarevok killed him.~
@267  = ~I don't want to talk about it.~
@268  = ~Why, so you can laugh?~
@269  = ~I'm surprised that you don't. They've apparently been meddling in your life for... how old did you say you were? Twenty-one?~
@270  = ~No matter. What became of the old fool?~
@271  = ~What, so you can laugh?~
@272  = ~At least the cynic lives for himself, rather than dying for all those who couldn't be bothered to fight for themselves... but I can see that your Harper keepers have been feeding you as much of their inane nonsense as they could.~
@273  = ~They took better than you think, I'd say.~
@274  = ~So I've noticed. What became of the old fool?~
@275  = ~I suspect you had more interesting things to focus on, though in a place that small, I can't imagine what.~
@276  = ~I... promise I won't.~
@277  = ~Hmm. Fair enough. I really can't say I blame you.~
@278  = ~Ahh. I see. You...had your vengeance, at least. That's... something to hold onto.~
@279  = ~I normally don't give a damn what people think of me, but...~
@280  = ~<CHARNAME> has no interest in either you or your silver-tongued lies, Zhent.~
@281  = ~Aren't your people supposed to be in favor of love and tolerance, Harper? No, don't answer that. I really don't care.~
@282  = ~Hmm, maybe we should take this conversation somewhere we won't have to worry about unwanted commentary. Despite what your Harper thinks of things, I... I don't know, <CHARNAME>. I guess I just don't want to leave you thinking the worst.~
@283  = ~I don't know, <CHARNAME>. I suppose I just don't want to leave you thinking the worst.~
@284  = ~I already don't think the worst.~
@285  = ~You've only lied to me so far. Why change things now?~
@286  = ~I haven't heard anything I haven't liked so far.~
@287  = ~I'd love to hear anything you want to share.~
@288  = ~Finally willing to let me in, are we?~
@289  = ~Now's not the best time.~
@290  = ~I'm not interested in any excuses you might give.~
@291  = ~You've put up with me so far, <CHARNAME>, you probably deserve a bit more information than what little I've already given.~
@292  = ~Probably?~
@293  = ~Then talk.~
@294  = ~It's your story. If you're willing to share it, I'm willing to listen.~
@295  = ~I've already heard more than enough. I'm not interested in your excuses.~
@296  = ~Maybe not, but blind faith? I'd rather give you a chance to base your opinions on something more substantial than that.~
@297  = ~What would be the point now?~
@298  = ~Maybe not, but whatever picture you've painted for yourself is probably still fairly far from the truth. That's not very promising, even if you like it. Especially if you like it.~
@299  = ~Good.~
@300  = ~Will wonders never cease.~
@301  = ~I know.~
@302  = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, you don't know me half as well as you think you do if you believe I intend to make any excuse at all.~
@303  = ~I've never been very comfortable with sharing, you know. When you build your life on lies and illusions, it's a hard habit to break, but something closer to the truth... hmm.~
@304  = ~Closer to the truth? Do you only plan on feeding me more half lies, then?~
@305  = ~Just tell me whatever you're comfortable sharing.~
@306  = ~You're not about to get sentimental on me, are you?~
@307  = ~Oh, I don't even care if you feed me lies. I'm sure they'll be marvelous.~
@308  = ~You know what? I'm not interested in your excuses after all.~
@309  = ~Sentimental? I certainly hope not. Anyway, there's nothing particularly sentimental about Sembia. Golden Sembia... named so because they don't give a damn there about anything but gold. I never did ask, have you ever been there yourself?~
@310  = ~I was never even allowed beyond the gates of Candlekeep before we had to flee.~
@311  = ~The land of cutthroat mercantilism? I wouldn't even want to visit.~
@312  = ~Not yet. I hope to change that someday.~
@313  = ~Oh, of course! It's an interesting country, isn't it?~
@314  = ~My life has been...colorful enough that embellishment would be somewhat superfluous. But don't think I'll forget that you've given me permission.~
@315  = ~My story starts in Sembia, I think. This part of it, at least. Golden Sembia... named so because they don't give a damn there about anything but gold. I never did ask, have you ever been there yourself?~
@316  = ~I couldn't tell you everything there is to know if I had a lifetime with which to do it. Without that, all you're ever going to know is a shadow of the truth.~
@317  = ~Right. Hmm. My story starts in Sembia, I think. This part of it, at least. Golden Sembia... named so because they don't give a damn there about anything but gold. I never did ask, have you ever been there yourself?~
@318  = ~Ah, yes. Your Harper prison. I suppose that's one thing I've never had to endure. Still, the first time I walked through the gates of Selgaunt... to be fair, I was terrified.~
@319  = ~It isn't really much worse than Amn, <CHARNAME>. More concerned with wealth than class, certainly, though I suppose I have to admit that the first time I walked through the gates of Selgaunt, I was terrified.~
@320  = ~Well, I'm afraid I'm no longer welcome anywhere in the country. A wonderful end to a wonderful adventure. The first time I walked through the gates of Selgaunt... to be fair, I was terrified.~
@321  = ~Interesting...? I suppose it is. Myself, the first time I walked through the gates of Selgaunt... to be fair, I was terrified.~
@322  = ~I was... twenty-three? Twenty-four? Something like that. The Sembians had gone on a killing spree about five years prior, butchering every Zhent mage they could get their hands on, and the memory of that nightmare was always on my mind. Delightful.~
@323  = ~This was right after the Time of Troubles. Honestly, after that mess, I guess I even preferred being in the heart of enemy territory to being back home.~
@324  = ~Dare I ask what you were doing in Sembia?~
@325  = ~What was going on back home?~
@326  = ~Come now. What's life without danger? The heart of enemy territory sounds like the best place to be.~
@327  = ~The Time of Troubles in Zhentil Keep. I can imagine. Didn't your god of tyranny drop by for a visit?~
@328  = ~Nothing too horrific.~
@329  = ~Holy war. Religious oppression. Ten bloody years of it. My refusal to worship Cyric would...not have gone over very well. Fortunately, that was one complication I mostly avoided. Quite possibly the only one. In any case... Sembia.~
@330  = ~<CHARNAME>, sometimes I think you're completely mad. In any case... Sembia.~
@331  = ~He did. It's...not something I like to think about, <CHARNAME>. In any case... Sembia.~
@332  = ~I wasn't a saboteur or dockside bandit or anything of the sort. Grandson of a lord myself, I was ordered to get close to one of the major merchant families, to win their favor and what passed for trust in Sembia, and then to simply... wait.~
@333  = ~Fortunately, Sembia is a nice land for a wizard. A very nice land. Spying and divination go hand in hand, and merchant lords in particular enjoy their kept mages. It's a pity Amn isn't as forward thinking about such things.~
@334  = ~I found myself a wealthy patron quickly enough. Eldan Foxmantle: fantastically rich, none too intelligent, and eager for more. He set me up in a seaside villa, surrounded by his own loyal guards.~
@335  = ~His security measures were more charming than effective in the end, but I suppose I should give him some credit for at least making the effort.~
@336  = ~Leeching off of rich merchants. I suppose it's easier than adventuring.~
@337  = ~Dare I ask how this story ends?~
@338  = ~Tell me, did you charm the guards or replace them?~
@339  = ~And you wonder why Amn hates mages so much!~
@340  = ~You know, it's people like you who give the Art a bad name.~
@341  = ~That's nice. I've had enough of this story now.~
@342  = ~Easier? Probably not. More comfortable, though...certainly. Of course, Foxmantle betrayed me in the end.~
@343  = ~In bloody ruin, naturally. The bastard betrayed me in the end.~
@344  = ~A little bit of both, I suppose. Though it didn't keep Foxmantle from betraying me in the end.~
@345  = ~Whatever their reasons are, I'm sure they're more complicated than the simple fact that we're a dangerous lot. But I don't particularly care about the history of this blighted country.~
@346  = ~Now, where was I? Ah, yes. Foxmantle. He betrayed me in the end, of course.~
@347  = ~If you insist. Now... where was I?~
@348  = ~Ah, yes. Foxmantle. He betrayed me in the end, of course.~
@349  = ~Suit yourself.~
@350  = ~It was... somewhat more complicated than that, I suppose, but the specifics hardly matter now. I fled the country afterwards, back to the Keep.~
@351  = ~It was... well, it was exactly as I had remembered it, but I suppose I had changed over the years. Plenty of merchants back home like to retire to gentler Sembia, and I can hardly blame them for that.~
@352  = ~Some people can shift between faces, becoming whomever they need to be at a moment's notice and then discarding the personality afterwards. I... never could. Not for years on end, at least.~
@353  = ~Some Zhentarim spy, hmm? I'd gone native in Sembia. I couldn't compete anymore. A paladin might not recognize the distinction, but that doesn't make it less real.~
@354  = ~My life in Zhentil Keep was over anyway. My superiors were not pleased with me for my failures in Selgaunt, and any hopes I might have once had for advancement were shattered. Harpers were writing mocking songs about me, and that's not the sort of thing that goes over very well back home.~
@355  = ~I'd probably have been killed outright, but sorcerers are too valuable to throw away.~
@356  = ~I'd probably have been killed outright, but was too valuable to simply throw away.~
@357  = ~I've noticed. It really is your only redeeming feature.~
@358  = ~I've noticed. Your magic really is your only redeeming feature.~
@359  = ~Mocking songs?~
@360  = ~What *did* they do to you?~
@361  = ~My heart bleeds for you.~
@362  = ~Go on.~
@363  = ~That's something, at least. I've had enough of this story now.~
@364  = ~I'd rather you didn't ask. And after that...~
@365  = ~Nothing pleasant. And after that...~
@366  = ~Aren't you simply a delight to<DAYNIGHT>? In any case...~
@367  = ~Aren't you simply a delight to<DAYNIGHT>, <CHARNAME>? Fine. I'll leave you alone, if that's what you'd prefer.~
@368  = ~Two years worth of running caravans in the area, and it... wasn't exactly pleasant. The opposite, really. I was quite the bitter thing back then. Needless to say, the caravan guards didn't care for my company. Not that there was a damn thing they could have done about it.~
@369  = ~It would have been nice to simply run, and I won't say the thought never occurred to me, but there was nowhere to go. It's hard to turn your back on your whole life, and I wasn't stupid enough to set foot in Sembia or Cormyr anyway.~
@370  = ~You're still a bitter thing, you know.~
@371  = ~You were afraid of retaliation, you mean.~
@372  = ~Didn't care for Zhent caravans, did you? Do I detect a burgeoning conscience?~
@373  = ~Fresh starts can be frightening, but sometimes there's nothing more rewarding than a new life.~
@374  = ~Running caravans... I'd hoped for something a bit more... romantic.~
@375  = ~You really did go soft, didn't you? I suppose we all can't be children of Bhaal.~
@376  = ~If you're aiming for sympathy, you're not getting anywhere.~
@377  = ~Heh. I suppose I am.~
@378  = ~Enough of this, <CHARNAME>. You have your story now, we'll... talk again later, I suppose.~
@379  = ~There's no point in denying it. They--~
@380  = ~Enough, <CHARNAME>. You have your story now, we'll... talk again later, I suppose.~
@381  = ~How... quaint, <CHARNAME>. If that's what you need to believe in order to be comfortable around me, though, I won't stop you.~
@382  = ~Is it, then? Well, maybe it's even true. I suppose we'll find out.~
@383  = ~No, I wanted... well, it doesn't really matter now, does it? If you expect me to cast myself as the villain of my own story, however, you're more a fool than those damned Harpers.~
@384  = ~I... see.~
@385  = ~Enough, <CHARNAME>. You have your story now, we'll...talk again later, I suppose.~
@386  = ~I suppose everyone is painted in grey next to you, <CHARNAME>. Bloodlust may not run through my veins as it does yours, but I'm far from weak, and further yet from gentle.~
@387  = ~Enough of this nonsense. If you don't much mind, I think I'll wander off and see if I can't find you some villages to conquer.~
@388  = ~Fine. Whenever you're ready.~
@389  = ~<CHARNAME>, you might want to try this.~
@390  = ~What is this?~
@391  = ~Not right now, Adrian.~
@392  = ~It's a... mostly naturally occurring remedy for sleepless nights. It began life as an answer to hangovers and... similar afflictions, before a priestess of Talona decided to experiment with it.~
@393  = ~Without telling anyone. She poisoned several people before we killed her, but one of the experiments was actually salvageable. And I suppose that was more than you wanted to know.~
@394  = ~Yeah... thanks, but a potion created by a cleric of the Mistress of Disease is not my idea of a smart move. Not that I didn't enjoy the story.~
@395  = ~That's... colorful, but if it's safe, I suppose I'll give it a try.~
@396  = ~Darling, I'd like to know quite a bit more than that.~
@397  = ~Most people, when they tell crazy stories, talk about glorious past exploits, not... whatever that was.~
@398  = ~My nights are fine, thank you very much. Not that I didn't appreciate the story.~
@399  = ~Understandable, though I assure you, this one is perfectly safe. As far as stories go, I've shared enough of my own for the moment. Yours, however...~
@400  = ~Not extremely colorful. But I've shared enough of my own stories for the moment. Yours, however...~
@401  = ~I don't doubt it, though I've shared enough of my own stories for the moment. Yours, however...~
@402  = ~Glorious past exploits? I tend to consider it bad policy to boast in public about deeds that would get me hanged for treason, conspiracy, and a number of other crimes up north. Your past exploits, however...~
@403  = ~As you like. If we're discussing stories, though, I think I've shared enough of my own for the moment. Yours, however...~
@404  = ~You know, I never quite got to Baldur's Gate. I always meant to, but the closest I've ever managed is apparently... well, here. How did you like it?~
@405  = ~Better than Athkatla, at least. Despite the Iron Crisis, it was easier to know who to trust. Athkatla's government is just one shade of grey.~
@406  = ~It seemed so big when I was there, but Athkatla has to be at least twice as large. Perhaps even Baldur's Gate would seem provincial if I went back.~
@407  = ~The power games in a place like that are a bit... addicting, I found.~
@408  = ~It was amazing. I was probably too caught up in my own adventure to tell you much about the city itself, though.~
@409  = ~I've never really cared for cities in general. I prefer wandering the countryside.~
@410  = ~I was a bit busy trying not to get killed to be interested in sight-seeing. I don't think I'd even want to go back... too many bad memories.~
@411  = ~At least it keeps you thinking, <CHARNAME>. Nobility and villainy and nothing in between... visions like that are the sign of a small mind, and small minds are of very limited value.~
@412  = ~But you... it's funny to think of you living secluded behind the walls of the tiny library, your destiny clawing at the gates.~
@413  = ~Someone like you, <CHARNAME>... I don't doubt that someday Waterdeep itself might not be large enough for you.~
@414  = ~But it's funny to think of you living secluded behind the walls of the tiny library, isn't it? Your destiny clawing at the gates.~
@415  = ~Yes, I know the feeling. Heh. It's funny to think of you living secluded behind the walls of the tiny library, isn't it? Your destiny clawing at the gates.~
@416  = ~I guess that's probably pretty common. We all view the world through the lens of our own private melodramas... some are just larger than others. Yours, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I suspect are as large as it gets.~
@417  = ~Still, it's funny to think of you living secluded behind the walls of the tiny library, your destiny clawing at the gates.~
@418  = ~Even the countryside was probably better there than in Amn. Not that I'd care to compare them... I think a couple of excursions into the Anauroch cured me of any great lingering affection for the natural world.~
@419  = ~But the city-hating hero upon whom the fates of many rest... it's funny to think of you living secluded behind the walls of the tiny library, your destiny clawing at the gates.~
@420  = ~No place to go but forward, is it? You know, it's funny to think of you living secluded behind the walls of the tiny library, your destiny clawing at the gates.~
@421  = ~The Hero of the Sword Coast... did they raise a statue in your honor, I wonder? They damn well better have. I can't imagine what it would be like, with a reputation like that. To be a hero...~
@422  = ~I do hope your mother warned you that your face could freeze like that.~
@423  = ~I've honestly never really thought about it.~
@424  = ~Get used to it. It's a reputation you now share in, vicariously or otherwise.~
@425  = ~Being welcome everywhere, adored... I grew up wanting wealth and excitement, and I suppose I have it now.~
@426  = ~You do what you have to do to be able to sleep at night. Doubly so when your blood is as corrupted as mine.~
@427  = ~It's rewarding. There are children all across the Sword Coast who will grow up with parents, because of me. That's powerful.~
@428  = ~Save a few villages, kill a handful of bandits, march through Baldur's Gate shining like the sun, and you can get the whole world eating out of your hand.~
@429  = ~My reputation was horrible. The nastier stories may not have reached Amn yet, but if I rescued the Sword Coast, it was only because I wasn't going to let my mad brother beat me.~
@430  = ~My mother never warned me about much of anything at all, and I doubt she'd have minded my sneers. Still...~
@431  = ~I credited you with more imagination than that, <CHARNAME>, but if you don't want to talk, then I see no point in forcing you. Still...~
@432  = ~Not vicariously enough, to be sure. Still...~
@433  = ~Ha! <CHARNAME>... such a glory hound, sometimes. Well, as long as you won't be handing our money off to every charity in Amn, I won't complain.~
@434  = ~I've earned every piece of gold. If I'm going to risk my life saving people, I expect some rewards.~
@435  = ~No more than I can afford, of course. Adventuring is so lucrative, I hardly need all of it.~
@436  = ~Call me a glory hound, if you want, but I really do like helping people.~
@437  = ~Good, because I won't listen if you do.~
@438  = ~Indeed. Endless gratitude only goes so far.~
@439  = ~If you don't want to invest your money wisely, I suppose that's your problem. Still, aside from that...~
@440  = ~Whatever makes you happy, I suppose. Still, aside from that...~
@441  = ~Ha! My <PRO_LADYLORD>, you wound me!~
@442  = ~Your blood is hardly your fault, <CHARNAME>. Certainly nothing to need to atone for.~
@443  = ~That's not it. The things I feel sometimes because of it... if I wavered in my convictions, I think Bhaal's taint would destroy me.~
@444  = ~I draw much of my power from a source that is evil. Unquestionably evil. I can't help but feel like I bear some responsibility for it.~
@445  = ~Do you know how many people have died for me? Have been killed because Sarevok came after me? The list starts with Gorion... no, it may well have started with my mother.~
@446  = ~You don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about, Adrian.~
@447  = ~Oh. That... makes a horrible sort of sense. Well, whatever you need to do to keep that in check, I have no quarrel with it.~
@448  = ~Don't be ridiculous, <CHARNAME>. You might as well blacken every mirror if you're that afraid of yourself.~
@449  = ~Still, you never lifted a sword or cast a spell in those situations... you really shouldn't blame yourself for them.~
@450  = ~No? I know a good deal more than you do if this is how you react to it.~
@451  = ~And there are children in Cormyr who will grow up as orphans because of me. That's rather powerful too.~
@452  = ~Oh, don't give me that look, <CHARNAME>. You walked into that one. In any case, I've done precious little pillaging in my time, so you needn't start getting righteous on me.~
@453  = ~I'm sure you felt like you had to do whatever you did.~
@454  = ~Were you always this insubordinate or am I just lucky?~
@455  = ~You don't need to be so bitter about everything.~
@456  = ~I know how viciously defensive you get whenever your bizarre mindset is challenged. As long as you don't wander off and start plotting to conquer Athkatla, I can handle it.~
@457  = ~You asked the question. You only have yourself to blame if you don't like the answer.~
@458  = ~Righteous as a paladin and as patronizing as a Harper, are we? Don't think I stick around because of your glorious virtue, <CHARNAME>.~
@459  = ~You're less likely to murder me for it than my old employers. But my insubordination aside...~
@460  = ~About everything? I wouldn't go that far. But my bitterness aside...~
@461  = ~Well, I suppose I should cross that off of my list of goals, then.~
@462  = ~I suppose I keep on hoping that one day I'll wake up to find that you've magically become sensible. But my wishes aside...~
@463  = ~Conquer the world through kindness, is it, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? As good a scheme as any, I suppose, and no more dangerous than wandering around setting villages on fire like a deranged madman. Probably less.~
@464  = ~Negotiate with some monsters to attack a wealthy merchant or village and then rush in to the rescue? If the monsters weren't already doing it without my help, it might be worthwhile.~
@465  = ~Honestly, it even feels good too. Look at me: I'm doing good things, everyone loves me, and now I'm rich. Everyone's happy, especially me.~
@466  = ~Conquer the world? That was the ultimate scheme, but I got grabbed by Irenicus before I could charm my way far enough into the government in Baldur's Gate.~
@467  = ~I thought you'd like that answer. You're really predictable sometimes, darling.~
@468  = ~Oh, we play games like that back home. Honestly, it's better to stick with the naturally occurring threats. Safer. Also, funnier when the Realms' most self-impressed start trying to question you.~
@469  = ~Ha! As long as you're enjoying yourself, I suppose it's for the best.~
@470  = ~Unpleasant, isn't it? To have everything one moment, and then the next...~
@471  = ~Listen to me, getting morose.~
@472  = ~And you apparently like to wrap yourself up in enigma as much as I do.~
@473  = ~Good. Hells, I won't claim that the Sword Coast didn't need to be saved... by all accounts, it did, but at least you're not some hapless idiot wandering around, too engrossed in everyone else's problems to notice your own.~
@474  = ~Honestly, I'd have happily let the entire Sword Coast burn if it wouldn't have meant my death also. I'd have enjoyed the show.~
@475  = ~I suppose some of the problems were probably legitimate, but people thinking it was reasonable to demand strangers to risk their lives to recover gaudy personal effects for them... I think not.~
@476  = ~There are enough hapless idiots wandering around. Faerun doesn't need another one.~
@477  = ~I thought you'd like that answer. You're really predictable sometimes.~
@478  = ~Happily? You've never even known anything but the Sword Coast, have you?~
@479  = ~Is that's Bhaal's influence, I wonder, crying out for bloodshed?~
@480  = ~And I'm sure you were a worthless evil monster if you refused. Ha.~
@481  = ~True enough.~
@482  = ~I have to give it to you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. At least you're not like so many of the Realms' supposedly goodly folk... too afraid of their own shadows to step off the righteous path, only good because they lacked the stomach or courage to be anything else. The so-called virtue of the timid and powerless. Disgusting.~
@483  = ~Thank you for the compliment. I think.~
@484  = ~That's uncharitable.~
@485  = ~Are you saying I could be darker?~
@486  = ~I take it that's not the sort of strength you're used to.~
@487  = ~Your flattery, for lack of a better term, doesn't interest me. Nor do you.~
@488  = ~I'm not a very charitable person, <CHARNAME>.~
@489  = ~Enough of this. Let's continue on. But do try the remedy. I know you're having trouble sleeping.~
@490  = ~You're a <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of Bhaal, <CHARNAME>. You could be as dark as you want to be.~
@491  = ~Ah, no matter. Let's continue on. But do try the remedy. I know you're having trouble sleeping.~
@492  = ~No, it really isn't.~
@493  = ~I like you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I wasn't sure I would, especially given your unfortunate Harper plagued upbringing, but you've impressed me more than once. Not many people do that.~
@494  = ~I'm glad to hear it.~

@584  = ~I suppose I'll have to try, but I'll admit, I can't help but wonder how he would have reacted had you dragged me home with you.~

@603  = ~It's made you more pragmatic, at least. You're fortunate to have broken free of his expectations.~
@604  = ~A decade ago... well. I'd have done just about anything to keep my own grandfather pleased with me, and he was quick enough to use that to his advantage.~
@605  = ~No, you do seem a bit more... pragmatic than he probably would have liked. That's for the best, I think. You'd probably have been murdered ten feet out of Candlekeep had it been otherwise.~
@606  = ~You're fortunate to have broken free of his expectations, though. A decade ago... well. I'd have done just about anything to keep my own grandfather pleased with me, and he was quick enough to use that to his advantage.~
@607  = ~No, you do seem a bit more... willful than he probably would have liked. I think you could try anyone's patience sometimes... though I know I have little enough room to speak there.~
@608  = ~You're fortunate to have broken free of his expectations. A decade ago... well. I'd have done just about anything to keep my own grandfather pleased with me, and he was quick enough to use that to his advantage.~
@609  = ~Really? I can't imagine what he might have found fault with, though I'm hardly the person to consult when it comes to deciphering Harper sensibilities. The whole lot of them are mad.~
@610  = ~Really? You may not be infuriating, but I still can't imagine what he might have found fault with. I'm hardly the person to consult when it comes to deciphering Harper sensibilities, though. The whole lot of them are mad.~
@611  = ~That sounds about right. A pity I'll never see it... there's nothing quite so entertaining as self-righteous outrage.~
@612  = ~But perhaps his approval isn't one of your priorities. That shouldn't be such a surprise, but... well. Myself, a decade ago... I'd have done just about anything to keep my own grandfather pleased with me, and he was quick enough to use that to his advantage.~
@613  = ~Apparently I misspoke.~
@614  = ~For his own incomprehensible ends, no doubt. Or perhaps because the alternatives were worse. I'm hardly the person to consult when it comes to deciphering Harper sensibilities, though. The whole lot of them are mad.~
@615  = ~But I take it his approval still matters to you? No surprise, that. Myself... a decade ago... well. I'd have done just about anything to keep my own grandfather pleased with me, and he was quick enough to use that to his advantage.~
@616  = ~That's... hardly what I meant. Forgive me for the figure of speech. But I take it his approval isn't one of your priorities? That shouldn't be such a surprise, but... well.~
@617  = ~ Myself, a decade ago... I'd have done just about anything to keep my own grandfather pleased with me, and he was quick enough to use that to his advantage.~
@618  = ~I take it his approval still matters to you? No surprise, that. Myself... a decade ago... well. I'd have done just about anything to keep my own grandfather pleased with me, and he was quick enough to use that to his advantage.~
@619  = ~I'd expect that he was probably more calculating than your guardian, but I know how Harpers can be.~
@620  = ~Gorion only wanted what was best for me. Whatever cunning was there, I never saw it.~
@621  = ~He lied to me about everything. That's as manipulative as it gets.~
@622  = ~He might have tried to push me in very specific directions, but I think I'm the better for his guidance.~
@623  = ~Gorion was a transparent fool. He would have liked to have used me, but I never let him.~
@624  = ~You know nothing about Gorion. Don't pretend otherwise.~
@625  = ~Well, truth be told, you're not supposed to see it.~
@626  = ~I'll never understand the way Heartlands folk try to protect their children from the world by leaving them utterly unprepared for it.~
@627  = ~It certainly isn't his guidance that has kept you alive so far.~
@628  = ~Loyal to the last, I see.~
@629  = ~Defiant to the last, <CHARNAME>? I do enjoy that.~
@630  = ~His approval really means nothing to you, then?~
@631  = ~My path isn't his, and I don't think he would have expected it to be.~
@632  = ~I may dislike him, but I wouldn't do anything that I thought would disgrace his memory.~
@633  = ~It means less than nothing. I'd go out of my way to make him roll over in his grave.~
@634  = ~I've never been interested in anyone else's approval.~
@635  = ~Less than it means to you, apparently.~
@636  = ~Does his approval still mean everything to you, then? It certainly seems like it once did.~
@637  = ~I wouldn't do anything that I thought would disgrace his memory.~
@638  = ~I'm grateful for what he did for me, but I've never sought anyone's approval.~
@639  = ~I may have loved him, but his standards were arbitrary and insane.~
@640  = ~It means less than it does to you, apparently.~
@641  = ~That's very... sensible of you, I think. Perhaps we'll survive this after all.~
@642  = ~That's... admirable, I suppose, though I can't help but fear for our longevity.~
@643  = ~No? I can't help but fear for our longevity.~
@644  = ~Mmm, I've noticed, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I dare say you're off to a very good start. Perhaps we'll survive this after all.~
@645  = ~Mmm, I've noticed, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. That's very... sensible of you, I think. Perhaps we'll survive this after all.~
@646  = ~Ha! Insane, I don't doubt. Arbitrary... well, I can guess at what they might have been easily enough, but if you don't care...~
@647  = ~That's very sensible of you, I think. Perhaps we'll survive this after all.~
@648  = ~It means... very little to me at all, <CHARNAME>.~
@649  = ~<CHARNAME>, you said the old Harper raised you, and I obviously know who your father was, but you haven't mentioned your mother.~
@650  = ~<CHARNAME>'s mother is none of your concern, Zhent. One would think your own history troubling enough that you would not see the need to prod at others' lives.~
@651  = ~That's almost comically hypocritical, Harper, wouldn't you agree?~
@652  = ~Stay away from her, Vasiliev. You may be attracted to the promise of power, but nothing good can come of this. You have already proven as much.~
@653  = ~You know *nothing* of me, Harper. Nothing but tales told so often that whatever truth once lay behind them is long since gone.~
@654  = ~<CHARNAME>, if my question hasn't offended you also... your mother, who was she?~
@655  = ~There's nothing to say. I never knew her.~
@656  = ~She died when I was born. I never knew her.~
@657  = ~I keep you around for your magic, not your company. Keep quiet.~
@658  = ~Ask me again sometime.~
@659  = ~Fine. Don't choke on your own venom.~
@660  = ~I'm sorry to hear it.~
@661  = ~I can't help but wonder what she must have been like, though, to catch... well, to catch your father's attention.~
@662  = ~I wish I knew more about her than I do. She was apparently a friend of Gorion's, though he never spoke about her.~
@663  = ~My past is so dark as it is, I'd rather just avoid any more revelations.~
@664  = ~Sometimes I think his only criteria was "breathing."~
@665  = ~I'm a child of Bhaal. When it comes to family history, that's the only thing that matters in the end.~
@666  = ~I can't really blame him for that, considering what must have happened.~
@667  = ~True enough. I can't really blame you for that.~
@668  = ~Sometimes I'm not even sure of that much.~
@669  = ~It's certainly the most important, yes, but the only key factor? I doubt that.~
@670  = ~It's a strange place to end up, though, isn't it? Candlekeep. A <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of Bhaal, sequestered by Harpers, hidden away from every danger but <PRO_HISHER> own cursed blood.~
@671  = ~I used to believe that simplistic upbringings bred weak fools, but maybe destiny does always win out in the end.~
@672  = ~Candlekeep may not have been a nightmare, but a childhood spent in preparation for an uncertain future is hardly simplistic.~
@673  = ~Destiny? I don't think so. If not for Candlekeep, I might have become as much a monster as Sarevok was. Who can really say?~
@674  = ~With destinies like mine, I don't think upbringing makes a difference one way or the other. The legacy demands greatness: grab it or die in the wake of those who did.~
@675  = ~I don't know. It's funny, when you think about it: one small, seemingly irrelevant change and everything about me might have been different.~
@676  = ~It is what it is. There's no point making such a deal about it.~
@677  = ~Fair enough, I suppose. Still, if not for that preparation, who can say what you would have become? I suppose sometimes I can't help indulging in the "what ifs" of life.~
@678  = ~People like you... like me... one small change and everything might have been different. Me, I was actually born in the Dalelands. The sickeningly sweet, "holier than thou" Dalelands.~
@679  = ~Funny, isn't it? Here I am, wondering what if. You said that your brother was raised by a leader of the Iron Throne, right? Who knows where the man originally came from.~
@680  = ~Me, I may be from one of the most ruthless cities in Faerun, but I was actually born in the Dalelands. The sickeningly sweet, "holier than thou" Dalelands.~
@681  = ~Fair enough, I suppose. You win or die, but... sometimes I can't help in indulging in the "what ifs." One small change, and everything might have been different.~
@682  = ~I don't know how much you think about things like this, <CHARNAME>. Me... I never used to, but I suppose after wrecking myself in Sembia, the "what ifs" crept in, whether I wanted them or not. One small change, as you put it.~
@683  = ~Me, I was actually born in the Dalelands. The sickeningly sweet, "holier than thou" Dalelands.~
@684  = ~No, I don't believe there is. But I suppose sometimes I can't help indulging in the "what ifs" of life, and people like you... like me... one small change and everything might have been different.~
@685  = ~I didn't actually grow up there, thank all the gods, but in another lifetime, I might have been your typical half-elven bard. Wandering the Realms, singing pretty songs of goodness and justice and other things that don't mean a damn thing in the end.~
@686  = ~And you might have been happier for it. What went wrong?~
@687  = ~So tell me, how did you escape that dire fate?~
@688  = ~That's a horrible, if slightly amusing, mental image. How did you end up in Zhentil Keep?~
@689  = ~I have enough to worry about in the present without indulging in sentimentality.~
@690  = ~You're no doubt right. Well, perhaps we'll talk again later. If you can spare the time, that is.~
@691  = ~What went wrong? Well, I suppose my father was too busy drifting around the Dalelands saving people from Zhents to realize that he was sleeping with one.~
@692  = ~Laugh, if you want. My mother was a Zhentarim agent. My father... well, I suppose he was too busy drifting around the Dalelands saving people from Zhents to realize that he was sleeping with one.~

@697  = ~This was Shadowdale, about thirty-five years ago. The Dale may be famous these days as the home of Elminster and his merry band of Harper fools, but back then, a man named Jyordhan had taken over.~
@698  = ~You've probably read about him. I know you had access to every book in Candlekeep.~
@699  = ~A Zhent puppet, wasn't he? Made the Dale interesting for a few years before he went and got himself killed by Khelben Blackstaff.~
@700  = ~Another petty Zhentarim tyrant who briefly terrorized the Dale before being eliminated by the Blackstaff, if I recall.~

@709  = ~So would I, truth be told. Perhaps there's something to be grateful for in this after all.~
@710  = ~Mmm, more or less. In any case, my mother... she'd been sent to Shadowdale about five years before Jyordhan's reign as a saboteur.~
@711  = ~I can't say why she got involved with an elven ranger of all things... to strengthen her own cover, most likely, though the subtle power game was probably too irresistible to pass up.~
@712  = ~Hells, perhaps it was even love. Stranger things have happened.~
@713  = ~You have quite the romantic streak sometimes, don't you?~
@714  = ~Mm, love between bitter enemies? Fairy tales are made of such stuff.~

@717  = ~I... guess I've had reason to wonder about things like that in the years since.~

@745  = ~Lovely as the dawn and sharp as a dagger's blade... if I didn't already know what your flaw was, <CHARNAME>, I would be wondering.~
@746  = ~My flaw?~
@747  = ~Is that supposed to be an insult or a compliment?~
@748  = ~'Lovely as the dawn?' Could I ask for some poetry next, my dear?~
@749  = ~Mmm. I would say it's my weakness for dangerous men.~
@750  = ~Well, I can list yours, if you'd like.~
@751  = ~I'm not playing a game of Zhentarim seduction. Get lost.~
@752  = ~Your evil, evil blood, my dear. What else?~
@753  = ~A compliment, I think. Your evil, evil blood...~
@754  = ~Poetry is for fools who can't write music, and I never had the inclination to learn an instrument. Your evil, evil blood, however...~
@755  = ~I won't say that's a flaw I've never exploited in the past. Your evil, evil blood, however...~
@756  = ~Ha! I'm not quite sure we have the time for that. Your evil, evil blood, however...~
@757  = ~...neither was I. Fine. I... won't bother you again.~
@758  = ~It's always something, isn't it? Granted, as flaws go, I'm not altogether sure that even that isn't a feature. You're something... new, at least.~
@759  = ~Hells, I... that was completely inappropriate.~
@760  = ~You're right. It was. But I've long since given up expecting much of anything from you.~
@761  = ~By your standards, it wasn't that horrible.~
@762  = ~Dare I even ask how drunk you are?~
@763  = ~If I wanted appropriate, I would grab a knight from Silverymoon.~
@764  = ~Well, I won't disappoint you, at least.~
@765  = ~No, I suppose not.~
@766  = ~Not as much as I'm going to be in ten minutes.~
@767  = ~Nine Hells, what a thought!~
@768  = ~You're not... I mean, I don't care about your heritage. Not really. I'm not--~
@769  = ~I suppose my history with women just leaves... something to be desired. To put it mildly. When the high point was a shortlived political marriage...~
@770  = ~Shortlived? What happened?~
@771  = ~Perhaps you should be more interested in the future rather than the past.~
@772  = ~Your history in general leaves something to be desired.~
@773  = ~You have a history, do you? Care to share?~
@774  = ~I'm not really comfortable with this conversation, Adrian.~
@775  = ~The Time of Troubles happened. It was a long time ago now, and... as I said. Politics.~
@776  = ~I... hmm. I think I'll just step away for a few minutes.~
@777  = ~Very funny.~
@778  = ~I'd really rather not.~
@779  = ~Truth be told, neither am I.~
@780  = ~ I... think I'll just step away for a few minutes.~
@781  = ~Of all the-- Careful with that, halfwit! You'd best watch where you're going while you still have eyes.~
@782  = ~If there's anything more obnoxious than the Amnish peasantry, I've yet to see it, though--~
@783  = ~The whole wretched path in front of you, and you walk into me--~
@784  = ~Ow! Godsdamned blasted rock!~
@785  = ~(chuckle) Had you watched where *you* were going, you would have noticed it, Zhent. But kick it a second time. Perhaps that will teach it a lesson.~
@786  = ~Harper, I swear--~
@787  = ~Calm down! You've been acting crazy all <DAYNIGHT>, Adrian, picking fights with every street vender in Athkatla. Are you okay?~
@788  = ~Calm down! You've been acting crazy all <DAYNIGHT>, Adrian, picking fights with every merchant in Trademeet. Are you okay?~
@789  = ~Calm down! You've been acting crazy all <DAYNIGHT>, Adrian. Are you okay?~
@790  = ~What the hells is wrong with you to<DAYNIGHT>?~
@791  = ~Brilliant tactical decision, kicking that rock after already tripping over it. You didn't break your foot, I hope.~
@792  = ~I'm *fine*, <CHARNAME>. Just... go back to whatever petty adventure has caught your attention this time and stay the hells away from me.~
@793  = ~Hold you tongue, warlock! I will not have you spitting your venom at the lady!~
@794  = ~Get out of my face, you pompous fool. Go bleat elsewhere, if you must.~
@795  = ~I do not *bleat*, Sianodel. Be glad I do not cut you down where you stand for the insult.~
@796  = ~As if you even could!~
@797  = ~Adrian, what in the Realms is the matter with you to<DAYNIGHT>?!~
@798  = ~Enough of this. I won't have you behaving like a child.~
@799  = ~You sound far from fine! Let me help you.~
@800  = ~Listen to yourself. You're no good to anyone like this.~
@801  = ~Fine. To the hells with you too.~
@802  = ~To the hells with you too, sorcerer. Anomen, stay away from him. He's not worth a fight.~
@803  = ~As you wish, my lady.~
@804  = ~Nothing. Why does something always have to be wrong with me?~
@805  = ~A child, am I?~
@806  = ~Help me? What do I look like, a pet project?~
@807  = ~Well, I suppose my utility is all that matters in the end. That's nothing new.~
@808  = ~Dammit, <CHARNAME>, I can't *think* straight like this.  Certainly not straight enough to keep from doing something completely idiotic.~
@809  = ~I just... just go away. You no doubt have more pressing concerns anyway.~
@810  = ~Something idiotic?  What are you talking about?~
@811  = ~Where is this coming from? Am I not allowed to be nice to you?~
@812  = ~I care about you, Adrian, violent moodswings and all. Whatever's going on in your head, just tell me.~
@813  = ~Nothing. Just... let me be.~
@814  = ~Nice? You're lucky I haven't taken advantage of your... dubious kindness and bled you dry. Just... let me be, <CHARNAME>.~
@815  = ~Just... let me be, <CHARNAME>.~
@816  = ~Could I speak with you for a moment, <CHARNAME>? Away from the others?~
@817  = ~I... wanted to apologize. I treated you terribly earlier and you didn't deserve it.~
@818  = ~An apology? From you? Hold on, is the world ending?~
@819  = ~Apology accepted. Could you tell me what was going on?~
@820  = ~You treat everyone terribly. Why should I be any different?~
@821  = ~I don't think I've ever heard you apologize. For anything. You can't even do it publicly, can you?~
@822  = ~A half-hearted apology isn't good enough.~
@823  = ~I only apologize when I'm truly sorry. That doesn't happen very often, but... well, you shouldn't be so surprised.~
@824  = ~I'd really rather not think about it.~
@825  = ~It's not quite the same thing... usually I do it intentionally.~
@826  = ~What do you want me to do? Get on my knees and beg you for forgiveness?~
@827  = ~As much as that would be a sight... no. Just tell me what was going on in your head the other day.~
@828  = ~No. I want you to promise that you won't attack me again with no reason or explanation.~
@829  = ~I want you to act like an apology isn't something to be ashamed of. If you're sorry, you can say it in front of the others also.~
@830  = ~It would be a start.~
@831  = ~I'll... try. More than that... I don't make promises I can't keep. Not real ones, at least.~
@832  = ~What? You can't be serious!~
@833  = ~Oh, the look on your face. That's all the apology I wanted.~
@834  = ~If you're going to be this impossible, never mind. You're forgiven.~
@835  = ~You heard me.~
@836  = ~Ha! You're a cruel woman sometimes, <CHARNAME>. I think that's one of the things I like most about you.~
@837  = ~But you're right.~
@838  = ~I... thank you, <CHARNAME>. But you're right.~
@839  = ~There's quite a bit I would do for you, <CHARNAME>, but this? I don't think so. If you don't want to accept my apology, fine. Rest assured, you won't be getting another.~
@840  = ~An outburst like that... it shouldn't have happened. Five years ago, it would never have, but... I don't know. I'm sorry.~
@841  = ~Stop worrying about it. It isn't a problem.~
@842  = ~I do care about you, Adrian. If you want to talk about things that bother you instead of throwing temper tantrums over them, I think we would both be happier.~
@843  = ~So you're not always in perfect control of yourself. That's nothing to be ashamed of.~
@844  = ~Two apologies for the price of one, is it? I could get used to this.~
@845  = ~I agree. It shouldn't have happened, and I would appreciate if it didn't happen again.~
@846  = ~Isn't it? I just... sometimes I wonder. I'd like to think I didn't go mad at some point without noticing, but with that damn siege back home...~
@847  = ~Thank you, I think. I just... sometimes I wonder. I'd like to think I didn't go mad at some point without noticing, but with that damn siege back home...~
@848  = ~Clever, <CHARNAME>. I just... sometimes I wonder. I'd like to think I didn't go mad at some point without noticing, but with that damn siege back home...~
@849  = ~I hope to avoid it myself. I just... sometimes I wonder. I'd like to think I didn't go mad at some point without noticing, but with that damn siege back home...~
@850  = ~All things considered, perhaps I should simply be glad I'm not a raving lunatic. Not everyone was so lucky.~
@851  = ~At least I would know where I stood with a raving lunatic.~
@852  = ~You're not mad. Terrible things happen, and we cope however we can. I know what it's like to feel overwhelmed.~
@853  = ~Darling, you may not be a raving lunatic, but I'm still not quite sure that you're sane.~
@854  = ~That's one positive to take from the whole situation, I suppose.~
@855  = ~I'm not interested in excuses or justification. Just accept responsibility for acting like a child and try not to do it again.~
@856  = ~Very funny. Well, I've said what I wanted. If you'd like a third apology as well, I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.~
@857  = ~True enough. Thank you, <CHARNAME>, but... well, I think I've said as much on the topic as I wanted to.~
@858  = ~Fine. In any case, I've said what I wanted. If you'd like a third apology as well, I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.~
@859  = ~You didn't have to keep me around, you know. After Tanya... that was quite a bit of trouble to go to. You didn't need to do it.~
@860  = ~Yes, I did.~
@861  = ~That was quite some time ago. Why are you bringing it up now?~
@862  = ~I didn't want to lose you.~
@863  = ~Humility doesn't become you, Adrian.~
@864  = ~And deprive myself of the service of a skilled sorcerer?~
@865  = ~And deprive myself of the service of a skilled mage?~
@866  = ~Every time you open your mouth, I can't help but remember that.~
@867  = ~Ah. Of course.~
@868  = ~Don't look away like that. You know full well I didn't want to lose you.~
@869  = ~Granted, your company has grown on me in the time since.~
@870  = ~I hope you weren't naive enough to think it was anything more.~
@871  = ~(say nothing)~
@872  = ~Fine. You can be sure, I won't do it again.~
@873  = ~Hardly.~
@874  = ~I honestly don't understand it, <CHARNAME>. You hardly even knew me.~
@875  = ~I'm a good judge of character.~
@876  = ~I knew you better than I knew your old friend.~
@877  = ~Well, if I sold out every good looking stranger, where would I be?~
@878  = ~I knew enough to know I cared about you.~
@879  = ~I don't like being challenged by people like that.~
@880  = ~Heh. That's certainly an interesting theory, if rather lacking in evidence. But perhaps it isn't much of a problem for you... trust, love, and every other foolish Harper concept.~
@881  = ~That shouldn't matter. But perhaps it isn't much of a problem for you... trust, love, and every other foolish Harper concept.~
@882  = ~Less likely to get yourself into pointless trouble, I should think. But perhaps it isn't much of a problem for you... trust, love, and every other foolish Harper concept.~
@883  = ~That's... insane, <CHARNAME>. Insane. But perhaps it isn't much of a problem for you... trust, love, and every other foolish Harper concept.~
@884  = ~You don't like being challenged at all, <CHARNAME>. But regardless, perhaps it isn't much of a problem for you... trust, love, and every other foolish Harper concept.~
@885  = ~Has it? Hmm. Perhaps it isn't much of a problem for you... trust, love, and every other foolish Harper concept.~
@886  = ~Your Gorion must have fed it to you alongside the rest of his lies.~
@887  = ~My, aren't we vicious to<DAYNIGHT>?~
@888  = ~They're not foolish concepts, Adrian. Life is meaningless without them.~
@889  = ~You've never trusted or loved before?~
@890  = ~He tried, but he didn't get very far. I've never trusted anyone in my life. I'd probably be dead if I had.~
@891  = ~For the last time, don't talk about him that way.~
@892  = ~I... no. If anything, perhaps I'm a bit jealous. I... never quite had the opportunity at all.~
@893  = ~And often over all too quickly with them, I've noticed. But maybe I haven't the experience to judge. I... never quite had the opportunity at all.~
@894  = ~Seldom wisely. I... never quite had the opportunity.~
@895  = ~Given your situation, quite possibly. Myself, I never quite had the opportunity at all.~
@896  = ~No childhood spent with a girl like Imoen... my foster siblings were my cousins, and they hated me. I had the occasional close friend before I moved to Sembia, but after that...~
@897  = ~I've never thought of it as lonely before, but I suppose it was. To a degree, at least.~
@898  = ~Lonely? How so?~
@899  = ~If you want lonely, try growing up in a place as tiny as Candlekeep.~
@900  = ~You had friends? I thought you people were always tripping over yourselves to kill each other.~
@901  = ~Yes, your life of luxury must have been dreadful.~
@902  = ~A hostile nation can't be very fertile soil for friendships.~
@903  = ~I was a spy in a hostile nation, <CHARNAME>. Getting particularly close to anyone would likely have gotten me killed.~
@904  = ~I'd suspect that was boring rather than lonely. In my experience, small towns normally are.~
@905  = ~I did say "occasional," <CHARNAME>. I was certainly very careful about it. That probably served me well.~
@906  = ~(smile) Indeed. Horribly so.~
@907  = ~You've figured that out, have you?~
@908  = ~I won't pretend that I didn't enjoy Sembia. The intrigue of it all was intoxicating, but... perhaps there's more to be said for this lifestyle than I would have expected.~
@909  = ~And here I thought you were convinced by the gold and magic we find everywhere.~
@910  = ~Does this mean you'll finally stop complaining whenever we camp outdoors?~
@911  = ~I for one intend to retire as soon as I get the chance.~
@912  = ~It does foster a certain closeness, doesn't it?~
@913  = ~That certainly plays a part as well, though less of one than you might think.~
@914  = ~Ahh, let's not ask for miracles just yet. One is enough for now.~
@915  = ~And I'd gladly do the same, but... well. Be that as it may.~
@916  = ~I wouldn't have thought as much, but... well. Be that as it may.~
@917  = ~ I... know I'm hardly the most honest man in Faerun, but I'm not going to betray you, <CHARNAME>. Strange as it is to put it into words. You do realize that, I hope.~
@918  = ~I didn't think you were.~
@919  = ~Forever is a long time.~
@920  = ~I trusted you more before you said that.~
@921  = ~Sincerity looks very good on you.~
@922  = ~It would be suicidally stupid of you if you did.~
@923  = ~I never really intended to. Even if you were a complete fool, I'd still have owed you too much. I don't trust that many people. I never have, but you...~
@924  = ~I know. And I keep my promises... the few I actually make. I don't trust that many people. I never have, but you...~
@925  = ~Heh. Had I been insincere, I probably wouldn't have fumbled through that quite so badly. I don't trust that many people. I never have, but you...~
@926  = ~I try not to make a habit of it. I don't trust that many people. I never have, but you...~
@927  = ~Sometimes it can be exceptionally hard to talk to you, <CHARNAME>. Funny, that I find myself trusting you anyway.~
@928  = ~I don't know. Hopefully this isn't just another terrible mistake. Heavens know, I've made enough of those.~
@929  = ~...<CHARNAME>? Ah, it is you.~
@930  = ~I take it there's no such thing as privacy, even at rest. Well, I guess I should be used to that by now.~
@931  = ~I'm sorry to interrupt, but you looked thoughtful.~
@932  = ~Staring absently into a copse of trees like this... you're not about to go elven on me, are you?~
@933  = ~Given the bottle of mead lying in the grass, you should be glad for that. Any number of monsters might find you too tasty a treat to ignore.~
@934  = ~Hmm? Oh, I suppose I do. I was thinking...~
@935  = ~No. I suppose that this is as close as I get. I was thinking...~
@936  = ~I'm not too drunk to cast invisibility, <CHARNAME>. I was thinking...~
@937  = ~Well, it's not that great a secret, if you want to hear it.~
@938  = ~Please.~
@939  = ~I'll listen.~
@940  = ~I'm not interested.~
@941  = ~Fair enough. I'll meet you back at camp, I suppose.~
@942  = ~Fine. I'll meet you there, I suppose.~
@943  = ~I've... only a single memory of my father. He was... seldom present. Too busy off rescuing lost kittens and whatever other nonsense was more important, but there was a grove somewhere near our home that he'd occasionally take me to when he was around.~
@944  = ~It looked a bit like this... at least, I think it did. Strange, isn't it? The things we remember even decades later. I half recall him naming off the different types plants for me, but I was, ah... too busy trying to bite off his pointed ear to pay much attention.~
@945  = ~Well, there's some cinnamon fern over there, and that tree...~
@946  = ~It wasn't his fault, you know. That she took you. If he had been around that day, then she would have just waited for a better chance.~
@947  = ~Stop daydreaming, Adrian. Sentimental excursions aren't going to get you anywhere, and I don't want you falling apart on me.~
@948  = ~You sound like you miss him.~
@949  = ~Biting his pointed ear? I'm suddenly afraid to let you close!~
@950  = ~This nostalgia is making me sick. I'm going back to camp.~
@951  = ~Hells, <CHARNAME>! I'd rather not associate you with my father. For a variety of different reasons.~
@952  = ~If he'd been around at all, he might have noticed. But it's a stupid thing to dwell upon now, I suppose.~
@953  = ~I'm hardly falling apart, <CHARNAME>, I just...~
@954  = ~You're right. He was a fool. An easily manipulated fool, and he doesn't deserve my reminiscence. I just...~
@955  = ~Miss him? I... no. What would be the point? I sometimes wish I'd had a chance to know him, at least a bit, but... hells, what a violent meeting that would be.~
@956  = ~Heh. I was only three, <CHARNAME>.~
@957  = ~I never used to think about things like this, but now... I suppose there's nothing like dismal failure to make you start obsessing over the might have beens.~
@958  = ~Oh, stop it. You're not a dismal failure.~
@959  = ~Well, you'd never have met me. That's not something I'd want to take back.~
@960  = ~Would you really want to erase thirty years of your life just because the last two haven't been very much to your liking?~
@961  = ~By all the gods, Adrian. I thought you were able to hold your liquor better than this.~
@962  = ~Okay, that's more than enough of this nonsense for me. I'm going back to camp.~
@963  = ~No? I suppose getting yourself sold into slavery is the epitome of success.~
@964  = ~Oh, enough of this.~
@965  = ~I suppose that's something positive to take away from the whole mess.~
@966  = ~No... no. You're right. Even parts of the last two years. Like now, for instance...~
@967  = ~I... gods, you're right. Enough of this.~
@968  = ~Here, I've half finished this bottle of mead, but there's plenty left if you'd like to share.~
@969  = ~That sounds lovely.~
@970  = ~Not a <DAYNIGHT> goes by that I don't find myself drinking with you nowadays.~
@971  = ~Enjoy it. I think I'd rather one of us be sober enough to keep from getting attacked by bandits or wild animals on the way back to camp.~
@972  = ~You've had more than enough as it is. Come on, let's go.~
@973  = ~You're very welcome.~
@974  = ~Bandits and wild animals? I'm a Zhent, <CHARNAME>, or at least fractionally so. Drunken debauchery is our thing. I know what I'm doing.~
@975  = ~I like this. You and me... without any of your mad friends in sight.~
@976  = ~You don't need to sit so far away, you know. I don't bite. Not exactly.~
@977  = ~I'm already sitting right next to you.~
@978  = ~I... um...~
@979  = ~I wouldn't mind it if you did. (smile)~
@980  = ~Apparently I need to get you drunk and sentimental more often.~
@981  = ~I'm beginning to think this was a bad idea. I'm going back to camp. Good night.~
@982  = ~...not closely enough.~
@983  = ~...I'll have to remember that.~
@984  = ~I'm not sure I like the sound of that, but...~
@985  = ~Hmm. As intoxicating as this mead is, you... <CHARNAME>...~
@986  = ~(He raises his hand slowly to your face, trailing the back of his fingers lightly across the line of your jaw. His eyes are slightly bright, with both drink and desire.)~
@987  = ~Oh...~
@988  = ~And suddenly so coy.~
@989  = ~(let him continue)~
@990  = ~(drag him closer and kiss him)~
@991  = ~I don't like where this is headed. I'm going back to camp. Good night.~
@992  = ~(His light grasp becomes suddenly firm, and he tilts your chin up, his lips finding yours.)~
@993  = ~(The kiss is demanding, though far from brutal, and you can feel his fingers brushing across the contours of your body before settling on your hip.)~
@994  = ~(With some reluctance, he finally pulls away, letting you up.)~
@995  = ~(Unbalanced, he barely keeps from collapsing on top of you as you draw him close.)~
@996  = ~(Despite that, he seems rather comfortable with this turn of events, and you can feel his fingers brushing across the contours of your body before settling on your hip.)~
@997  = ~(He finally pulls away after a long moment, a strange expression on his face.)~
@998  = ~That was... I...~
@999  = ~Hells, <CHARNAME>, I'm sorry. That was... utterly inappropriate. Too much mead, I think.~
@1000 = ~I can't think like this either. Let's call it a night.~
@1001 = ~The only thing you should be apologizing for is the fact that you stopped.~
@1002 = ~Too much mead? Not enough, apparently.~
@1003 = ~Right. Let's pretend this never happened.~
@1004 = ~Agreed. Let's... talk about this later.~
@1005 = ~I... let's talk about this later.~
@1006 = ~I'm... sorry, <CHARNAME>. It won't happen again. Let's... let's get back to the others.~
@1007 = ~<CHARNAME>? Ah, good, you're awake. We need to talk. I went ahead and made breakfast, and there's an extra potion here for hangovers if you need it, but...~
@1008 = ~Right. We need to talk.~
@1009 = ~Oh, this looks good! Thank you.~
@1010 = ~What's wrong? You don't look too happy.~
@1011 = ~What is this? You never get up early. And you can't cook!~
@1012 = ~You're right, we do.~
@1013 = ~About what happened last night... I don't think it should happen again.~
@1014 = ~I see. That's... probably for the best, then.~
@1015 = ~Enjoy it. Last night--~
@1016 = ~I... About last night--~
@1017 = ~Your praise brings tears to my eyes, <CHARNAME>. I... guess I just couldn't sleep very well. Last night--~
@1018 = ~You're right. We do. Last night--~
@1019 = ~Because, last night--~
@1020 = ~Gods, this is an awkward conversation if ever there was one. Tell me, last night... did it mean anything to you?~
@1021 = ~Don't be ridiculous! Of course it did.~
@1022 = ~I'm not sure yet, but I think I'd like it to.~
@1023 = ~Don't tell me that it meant nothing to you.~
@1024 = ~I won't say I didn't like it, but... no. Not particularly.~
@1025 = ~Well, it made me question my sanity, if that counts.~
@1026 = ~I see. That's... I don't know, I'm not sure what to say, <CHARNAME>.~
@1027 = ~No, that's not what I meant, but... I'm not sure what to say, <CHARNAME>.~
@1028 = ~I have a weakness for wine and beautiful women. I always have. Precious little good has ever come of it, and you--~
@1029 = ~And I deserve better, is that what you mean to say?~
@1030 = ~Stop calling me beautiful. I'm really not.~
@1031 = ~You've been blowing hot and cold for a while now. Are you interested or not?~
@1032 = ~What are you so afraid of?~
@1033 = ~You've got a hell of a lot of hang-ups, don't you? Don't worry, I'm not interested anymore.~
@1034 = ~What? No. I doubt you'd be able to find much better in a place like this, but I--~
@1035 = ~Stop changing the subject, <CHARNAME>. You're one of the most magnificent women I've ever known, but I--~
@1036 = ~I... am. I won't deny that. <CHARNAME>, you're one of the most magnificent women I've ever known, but I--~
@1037 = ~Afraid? I'm afraid of making the sort of mistake that will get us both killed. I--~
@1038 = ~I might have said I made mistakes in Sembia. Terrible mistakes. I... never said exactly what they were.~
@1039 = ~I can guess well enough.~
@1040 = ~Out with it. Now.~
@1041 = ~You know I don't care about your past.~
@1042 = ~I'm getting sick of the way you hide away whatever pieces of information are the most important. Just stay away.~
@1043 = ~Well, I can't exactly run away from it, can I?~
@1044 = ~Seven years can be a long time, especially in an environment like that. I'd grown... careless. Too confident, perhaps. Or maybe I was just tired of the endless charade and looking for any excuse to self-destruct. I couldn't really say.~
@1045 = ~I usually worked alone. For the most part it was safer that way, but every so often my masters would have... unrelated interests in the city, and I'd find myself with some unwanted company. Towards the end... her name was Sadi'a. Sadi'a al-Shadir.~
@1046 = ~ An exiled Calishite noblewoman, if her stories were true. It was always hard to tell with her... she existed as much on fantasy as reality. She'd claimed to have fled the country after murdering an unwanted suitor, and that much I can believe. Calishites.~
@1047 = ~She'd turned her little hobby into a career and been recruited as an assassin, and... it was stupid, I admit. It was unbelievably stupid, but I didn't care. I'd grown bored, I think, and she was... exhilarating, if nothing else.~
@1048 = ~What happened?~
@1049 = ~I take it she betrayed you?~
@1050 = ~I really don't want to hear this.~
@1051 = ~Fine. If you're not interested, I certainly don't need to share it.~
@1052 = ~Not exactly.~
@1053 = ~Too much wine one evening and I found myself in her bed in the morning, with precious little memory of what had happened in between. That's why last night... I didn't want that mad mess again, <CHARNAME>. The first time very nearly got me killed.~
@1054 = ~Sadi'a and I... we never quite got along. Maybe too much abuse at the hands of Calishite men had left her hating the whole lot of us. I don't know. Our relationship -- if you could call it that -- was more an extended power game than anything else.~
@1055 = ~It was obsessive, and it burnt out quickly, but... hells, I'm not even sure I would take it back. When we weren't hurting each other, it was... almost worth it.~
@1056 = ~Almost worth it? It certainly doesn't sound like it.~
@1057 = ~I think I can see where this is going.~
@1058 = ~I think I've heard enough.~
@1059 = ~You'd be surprised. I lived on mind-games back then, and that-- well, it was one of the best. In the end, I suppose that was our undoing.~
@1060 = ~It's fairly obvious, I should think. I lived on mind-games back then, and that-- well, it was one of the best. In the end, I suppose that was our undoing.~
@1061 = ~We got sloppy, and Selgaunt isn't exactly a city that rewards recklessness. Suddenly neither of us was quite as out of sight as we would have liked to be. Seven years of caution undone in a matter of weeks. Ridiculous, I know, but trying to clean up the mess only made it that much worse.~
@1062 = ~Then Sadi'a botched an assassination... a relative of my own master who had been asking the wrong questions, and Foxmantle started fitting the pieces together. Started speaking to Harpers. I slit his throat as soon as I realized how bad things were getting, but it was too late by then. Far too late.~
@1063 = ~I fled after that. Crawled back home, too panicked to recognize that for a serious mistake. Failures and setbacks are understandable, but fiascos like that... I was lucky I wasn't executed.~
@1064 = ~Sadi'a... Sadi'a knew better. She just ran. She didn't get far, though. They gave me her head after they caught her. "Sorcerers may be harder to replace, but make another foolish mistake, and you can be a matching pair."~
@1065 = ~Sadi'a... Sadi'a knew better. She just ran. She didn't get far, though. They gave me her head after they caught her. "You may be harder to replace, but make another foolish mistake, and you can be a matching pair."~
@1066 = ~I... gods, <CHARNAME>, I never lived that down.~
@1067 = ~And you didn't think that it might have been a good idea to tell me about this before?~
@1068 = ~That's horrible! I'm so sorry.~
@1069 = ~But you're away from them now. You don't need to worry about something like that happening again.~
@1070 = ~You... murdered a man. And now you're so self-absorbed that all you can think of is your own problems?~
@1071 = ~That's more of an insight into your old world than I was ready for. You're right, this is a terrible idea.~
@1072 = ~I suppose I should have, but... it's not a very easy story to share.~
@1073 = ~Horrible? That's Zhentil Keep, <CHARNAME>. If I could hunt down the lot of them, I would, but I haven't the power for that.~
@1074 = ~I *know* that, <CHARNAME>. I just...~
@1075 = ~He betrayed me to my enemies. What should I have done instead? Kissed him? A funny time to be having moral qualms, my lady.~
@1076 = ~You knew what I was, <CHARNAME>. But if you're not comfortable anymore... Well, we can forget this ever happened.~
@1077 = ~I haven't actually been involved with anyone since. I can't say I've even wanted to be, and to change that now...~
@1078 = ~Well, I suppose I've probably scared you away with this anyway.~
@1079 = ~It is a bit much.~
@1080 = ~You have some demons. Who doesn't? If I was going to be frightened away so easily, I'd have run from myself long ago.~
@1081 = ~I've heard worse. In fact, I've lived through worse.~
@1082 = ~Honestly, I think the whole thing is just irresistibly romantic.~
@1083 = ~Scared? No. You have my sympathy, but you won't chase me away that easily.~
@1084 = ~<CHARNAME>, daughter of Bhaal... I suppose that's true. You never do make things easy, do you?~
@1085 = ~I... enough of this. We'll talk later. Just enjoy breakfast. Assuming it's edible.~
@1086 = ~No, I suppose not. You never do make things easy, do you?~
@1087 = ~Do you? That's probably the most frightening thing *I've* heard all <DAYNIGHT>.~
@1088 = ~Enough of this. Just enjoy breakfast. Assuming it's edible.~
@1089 = ~I've been avoiding you, haven't I? Some wondrous display of courage that is.~
@1090 = ~You need time. I understand that. You have a lot to work through.~
@1091 = ~You're right, it is cowardly. We need to talk about this.~
@1092 = ~Finally come to apologize, have you?~
@1093 = ~You're working yourself up over nothing, though I suppose that's nothing new. I'm not interested anymore.~
@1094 = ~Still, I'm sorry. It's hardly your fault.~
@1095 = ~Talk? What's left to say? I... I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I really am.~
@1096 = ~I have. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I really am.~
@1097 = ~I see. Perhaps... perhaps that's for the best.~
@1098 = ~I just do everything backwards, don't I? Sack my city, sell me into slavery... that I can handle, but something as simple as this...~
@1099 = ~What a joke.~
@1100 = ~I honestly don't think you're doing a very good job of handling any of it.~
@1101 = ~You've never really survived by letting anybody close before.~
@1102 = ~If you stopped thinking about it so much and just let it happen, you'd feel better.~
@1103 = ~Love is never so simple. If it were, the poets would have significantly less material for their tragedies.~
@1104 = ~I really don't want to hear it.~
@1105 = ~I've seen people do a good deal worse, <CHARNAME>. I can assure you of that much.~
@1106 = ~Not with a great deal of success, at least.~
@1107 = ~Would I? I don't know.~
@1108 = ~I dare say I've given the damn bards enough to work with as it is.~
@1109 = ~I see. Then I won't bother burdening you with it.~
@1110 = ~It's such a foolish thing to get worked up over, I know. Still... I guess I've just always been so reckless in the past. Even before Sadi'a and her games.~
@1111 = ~I'll admit I've survived so long as much through luck as skill, but... hells, <CHARNAME>. I'm getting too old to take such stupid risks.~
@1112 = ~There's a difference between learning from your mistakes and giving up entirely, you know.~
@1113 = ~Do you really think we'll fly out of control that easily? Have more faith in yourself. And in me.~
@1114 = ~I'm not asking you to play games. If you've always played mind-games in the past, it's no wonder you got so burned.~
@1115 = ~You'll regret this far more if you run from it.~
@1116 = ~If you're trying to sabotage yourself, you're certainly succeeding.~
@1117 = ~My mistakes... as much as I'd like to pretend I've never actually made any... I don't know. You may be right.~
@1118 = ~Faith... you'd think that it would come more easily to me than it actually does. But... I don't know. You may be right.~
@1119 = ~Always? No, not always, but... I don't know. You may be right.~
@1120 = ~Will I? I... I don't know. You may be right.~
@1121 = ~I suppose I've more than enough experience with that. But... I don't know.~
@1122 = ~Does this really mean so much to you?~
@1123 = ~Despite everything, it does. How could it not?~
@1124 = ~I care about you. A lot. And I don't like seeing you like this.~
@1125 = ~If you can get your head together again, it would.~
@1126 = ~Nothing's worth this much.~
@1127 = ~I see. And despite everything, I suppose... I suppose I'm actually relieved. Just give me some more time to think, <CHARNAME>. Please.~
@1128 = ~Could I have a word, <CHARNAME>? Away from the others?~
@1129 = ~Yes, of course.~
@1130 = ~This is a bad time. Perhaps later.~
@1131 = ~I'm not interested in anything you might say.~
@1132 = ~Thank you.~
@1133 = ~Are you feeling any better about things?~
@1134 = ~I do hope you're finally over your melodrama.~
@1135 = ~So what delightful little secret do I get to learn to<DAYNIGHT>?~
@1136 = ~You did plan on saying something, I hope.~
@1137 = ~I don't appreciate that, <CHARNAME>.~
@1138 = ~I'm sorry. That was uncalled for.~
@1139 = ~Fine! I apologize.~
@1140 = ~Too damn bad.~
@1141 = ~No? Very well, then.~
@1142 = ~Then I suppose we have nothing further to say.~
@1143 = ~I think so. I'm no longer panicking, at least, though when I think about it...~
@1144 = ~Thank you. And yes, I am feeling better, though when I think about it...~
@1145 = ~Yes, I did. I was just thinking about us. I suppose that's not particularly surprising, but...~
@1146 = ~What a strange picture we would make. I can't really say that I even understand it.~
@1147 = ~You know full well that I don't give a damn about righteousness and glory and whatever other nonsense the Realms' heroes excite themselves over. I've done things even I'm not comfortable with, and I'm comfortable with just about everything.~
@1148 = ~I honestly didn't expect you to let me stay at all, but this? Hells, <CHARNAME>, I'm surprised you can even look at me and see anything but a potential enemy.~
@1149 = ~I don't hold people's pasts against them. You've been trustworthy in the time I've known you.~
@1150 = ~I believe in second chances. In any case, everybody knows that love conquers everything.~
@1151 = ~I'm a daughter of Bhaal, Adrian. I know more about darkness than you think I do. If I can bear my own demons, I think I can handle yours also.~
@1152 = ~Stop painting the world in black and white. You're not a monster and you're not my enemy.~
@1153 = ~I don't care about self-righteousness and glory nearly as much as you think I do.~
@1154 = ~You're right. When you put it like that, it isn't very appealing.~
@1155 = ~I might have been a nice catch for a lady such as yourself several years ago, but look at me now... a fallen lord from a fallen city, sunken so low as to have fallen into slavery. Renegade. Hunted. Not nice things to have to admit to, but nothing you don't already know.~
@1156 = ~There's precious little I have to offer anymore, <CHARNAME>. No money, no power, not even a title at this point. I'm sure you realize that.~
@1157 = ~And none of that matters to me. I have money and power to spare anyway.~
@1158 = ~Nothing to offer? You're still awfully good looking, you know.~
@1159 = ~All of that is redressable. You'll get on your feet again, even if I have to drag you off the ground.~
@1160 = ~I'm a daughter of Bhaal, Adrian. Political unions are for lesser people.~
@1161 = ~You're right. There is nothing I want here.~
@1162 = ~That's... generous. And you've held true to it thus far, so I ought to trust you, and I suppose I do.~
@1163 = ~I can't quite tell whether you're being naive or flippant. Regardless...~
@1164 = ~Hmm. That may well be so.~
@1165 = ~No, I'm not.~
@1166 = ~Ahh... you missed the point.~
@1167 = ~You'd be better off thinking with your head, <CHARNAME>.~
@1168 = ~Hells, <CHARNAME>. This isn't a joke.~
@1169 = ~Hells! And you would too, wouldn't you?~
@1170 = ~A lesser person, am I?~
@1171 = ~You know, I've actually come to respect you. Despite everything, despite how much disdain I've always felt for the so-called forces of good, you... hells, <CHARNAME>, you pull it off well. You make it almost attractive.~
@1172 = ~Don't think I want to join you in your idealistic bliss, but I can actually respect your convictions, even if the reverse is probably not true.~
@1173 = ~Well, you're hardly the type to start spouting sanctimonious drivel anyway, and thank all the gods for that, but...~
@1174 = ~I'm not going to wake up one morning and decide to go crusading or whatever other nonsense. I may not care so much for villainy these days, but I don't give a damn about atonement or guilt or whatever else you might think I should feel.~
@1175 = ~And I honestly can't help but wonder where the line is, at what point you'll wake up and decide that you ought to hate me instead. And that... <CHARNAME>, that terrifies me.~
@1176 = ~I'm not so naive that I don't already understand what you've been involved in. I don't hate you because of it, and that isn't going to change.~
@1177 = ~I won't tell you how you should feel, but I expect the same in return. As long as your past deeds stay in the past, I won't care about them.~
@1178 = ~If I ever feel troubled by anything, I will let you know. It's possible to end things without spiraling into madness.~
@1179 = ~I don't hate you, Adrian. You're moody, vicious, and intolerant, but I can take the bad with the good.~
@1180 = ~You're not half as bad as you seem to think you are. I see nothing worthy of hatred.~
@1181 = ~Look at you: a veritable demigoddess. My lady, you are transcendant, and me... as I said, a fallen lordling from a shattered keep. To be a consort to one such as yourself... I'll admit that the thought is thrilling, but thrilling has earned me nothing but trouble in the past.~
@1182 = ~I've played games before, romances built around manipulation and power games. It's not like it wasn't my life for the better part of a decade. Funny, a man like me asking for something different, but... I can't do it again. And I don't want to.~
@1183 = ~Rest assured, neither do I. I have enough of the world out to get me, I'd prefer a lover I can trust.~
@1184 = ~Do you really think so poorly of me? When have I ever mistreated those closest to me?~
@1185 = ~You're going to bore me to death now, aren't you?~
@1186 = ~Do I look like a drow matron mother? A flattering comparison, to be sure, but I treat my males with a bit more kindness than that. (smile)~
@1187 = ~I don't want this to blow up in my face either. I've waited this long, and I'll respect whatever lines you want to draw.~
@1188 = ~I'm sorry, what were you saying? You lost me at "demigoddess" and "transcendant." My, but you know how to flatter a woman.~
@1189 = ~I suppose that's really all I can hope for.~
@1190 = ~Good. That's... reassuring. Thank you.~
@1191 = ~You do have a way with words. Still, that's reassuring. Thank you.~
@1192 = ~Are you really so naive, <CHARNAME>? I...~
@1193 = ~Never mind. Let's just drop this entirely.~
@1194 = ~Hells, <CHARNAME>. Can you please at least try to take this seriously?~
@1195 = ~I am taking it seriously. I don't mistreat the people I care for. You should know that by now.~
@1196 = ~I know, I know. You needn't worry. I've waited this long; I'll respect whatever lines you want to draw.~
@1197 = ~If you're going to get sickeningly sentimental about things, I don't see what alternative I have.~
@1198 = ~You're not allowed to talk to me like that, male.~
@1199 = ~Good. And you can, <CHARNAME>. I promise you that much.~
@1200 = ~No, you're right. I guess I just needed to hear it.~
@1201 = ~Hmm. So it would seem.~
@1202 = ~Good. That's what I needed to hear.~
@1203 = ~Nothing. I wasn't saying anything at all.~
@1204 = ~I see. I suppose that answers my question for me.~
@1205 = ~No? Then we have nothing further to say.~
@1206 = ~That was my one real concern. The only rational one, at least. If I thought we were destined for failure and bloody disaster, I would never have shared this much, but... I do trust you, <CHARNAME>. As hard as that may be to believe right now.~
@1207 = ~It sounds so simple when put into words, but if it's poetry you want, you'd best look elsewhere. Still, if you'd like to try this after everything...~
@1208 = ~I do. I'm sure we can make it work.~
@1209 = ~Do you need to make it sound so much like a marriage proposal?~
@1210 = ~I don't think so.~
@1211 = ~Oddly enough, I think we can too.~
@1212 = ~No chaos, no madness, no confusion. (smile) At least for now. I hope you don't mind taking things slowly for a while.~
@1213 = ~I think I'd like that.~
@1214 = ~As long as I still get to kiss you again.~
@1215 = ~Do you really need to be so skittish about this?~
@1216 = ~I'm really not interested in this much work.~
@1217 = ~Hmm? Oh. (smile) I suppose in my experience, marriage proposals are highly contractualized and signed in blood.~
@1218 = ~No, I'm hardly asking for that. I'd much rather take things slowly, honestly.~
@1219 = ~And you tell me this now? Fine.~
@1220 = ~Mmm, I think we can make allowances for that.~
@1221 = ~Skittish? No. I'm not going to turn and run, <CHARNAME>, I just want to be more careful this time.~
@1222 = ~I'd be lost in this country if I didn't know how to play the black market. Of all things to be all but illegal... books.~
@1223 = ~What horrors are you reading about to<DAYNIGHT>? Planning on raising an undead army?~
@1224 = ~Could you please stop picking and choosing which laws you feel like following?~
@1225 = ~I can't believe it either. The pursuit of knowledge should never be illegal.~
@1226 = ~Careful there that you don't spill wine all over my spellbooks. Could you put that drink away?~
@1227 = ~If you stopped spilling wine all over them, you wouldn't need to constantly buy new copies. Could you put that drink away?~
@1228 = ~So he finally pulls his nose out of his books! And here I thought you had forgotten about me completely.~
@1229 = ~I'd be lost in this country if I didn't know how to play the black market. Hells, of all things to be all but illegal... books.~
@1230 = ~Ah! He finally pulls his nose out of his books and notices that he has companions!~
@1231 = ~Nothing so crass. It's a treatise on enchantment, actually. Why control the dead when you can control the living, my <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@1232 = ~Laws as stupid as this one don't count, as far as I'm concerned.~
@1233 = ~Hmm. I'm not sure how much I'd care to see the secrets of the Art in the hands of any pathetic fool, but... well, for once I sympathize with the sentiment.~
@1234 = ~I haven't spilled wine on anything, <CHARNAME>. I'm not quite that drunk yet.~
@1235 = ~Very funny, <CHARNAME>. But you're right. I probably should put the damn thing away for now. Maybe I'll find something more interesting the next time I look.~
@1236 = ~Never, <CHARNAME>. But you're right. I probably should put the damn thing away for now. I don't want to seem entirely unsocial to<DAYNIGHT>.~
@1237 = ~That's enough reading for one <DAYNIGHT>, though. Maybe I'll find something more interesting the next time I look.~
@1238 = ~That's enough reading for now, though. I don't want to seem entirely unsocial to<DAYNIGHT>.~
@1239 = ~Could you hand me that bottle over there? The Evereskan one? Whatever else can be said about the elves, they do make a fine wine.~
@1240 = ~It is pretty good, isn't it? You probably should have asked for it before I finished it.~
@1241 = ~So you've finally discovered something good about the elves!~
@1242 = ~You actually like this elven stuff? You can keep it. I prefer something a bit heavier myself.~
@1243 = ~I suppose I should just be glad you're not into anything worse than wine.~
@1244 = ~If you manage to get yourself killed in the morning because you're too hung over, don't expect me to have you raised again.~
@1245 = ~You... oh, I didn't even notice. I'll have to grab a different vintage, then.~
@1246 = ~Don't expect me to make a habit of it.~
@1247 = ~Dwarven grog, is it? Well, there's more than enough of that as well.~
@1248 = ~No... not anymore, at least. It caused more problems than it solved.~
@1249 = ~You needn't worry about that... potions can be wonderful things. One early morning ambush while hungover a year or so back was more than enough to never risk it again.~
@1250 = ~At the risk of sounding trite... you know, I'd actually forgotten how good this felt. Though I suppose that it's equally possible that I'd never really known.~
@1251 = ~Well, I'm glad you're happy.~
@1252 = ~I take it you're not talking about the wine anymore.~
@1253 = ~Don't congratulate yourself too much. You're the one who almost refused.~
@1254 = ~I'd certainly hope it feels good. Your hands are roaming freely enough.~
@1255 = ~And I am... perhaps I'd forgotten how that felt as well.~
@1256 = ~Very perceptive of you, my dear.~
@1257 = ~And you'll never let me forget that, will you?~
@1258 = ~So they are... if you don't like it, just slap me away.~
@1259 = ~Hmm. It's surprisingly easy to forget how young you are, <CHARNAME>. That's no wonder, as you've accomplished more in your twenty odd years than most people do in a lifetime, but... well.~
@1260 = ~I've been meaning to ask you... have you ever done this before?~
@1261 = ~I don't read minds, Adrian.~
@1262 = ~You're more drunk than you realize if you think that's a coherent question.~
@1263 = ~Done what? Curled up next to the fire with a mad sorcerer?~
@1264 = ~Done what? Curled up next to the fire with a mad wizard?~
@1265 = ~Adventuring? You know full well that I've been doing this for more than a year now.~
@1266 = ~Taken a lover, you mean?~
@1267 = ~And thank the gods for that. You're dangerous enough as it is. No, I meant... this. Taken a lover.~
@1268 = ~Heh. I'm surprised you still expect coherence from me at all. No, I meant... this. Taken a lover.~
@1269 = ~Mmm, I hope you don't make a habit of it, my dear. Most aren't as tame as I am. But I meant... this. Taken a lover.~
@1270 = ~No, no. Not that. I meant... this. Taken a lover.~
@1271 = ~I can't imagine the opportunity ever presented itself much at Candlekeep, unless you had a taste for self-righteous hermits and old men... if that's the case, I'm glad to have cured you of it.~
@1272 = ~But I know you've done little but run in the time since, and on the long road, the chances for... love, as it were, are few and far between.~
@1273 = ~You're definitely not my first. I hope that doesn't bother you.~
@1274 = ~Self-righteous hermits? Why have someone around to congratulate me on good deeds when I can keep a lover who complains about them instead?~
@1275 = ~People can get close on the road. You must have noticed that by now. (smile)~
@1276 = ~Until now, I'd agree with that sentiment. The opportunity never much presented itself before.~
@1277 = ~And yet I'm sure you've seen me flirting with half the eligible men in Amn.~
@1278 = ~Stop being melodramatic about it. What do I look like, a Sunite?~
@1279 = ~After my history? No. If anything, it's reassuring. I'd prefer to think that at least one of us actually knows what we're doing.~
@1280 = ~Oh, do be fair. I haven't complained in quite some time. I try not to annoy you too much, <CHARNAME>.~
@1281 = ~So it would seem. I had never really believed it possible before... though that may well have said more about the company I was keeping than anything else.~
@1282 = ~Then I should consider myself very, very lucky. You could have very easily been snatched up several years ago, <CHARNAME>.~
@1283 = ~Yes... and I would really rather you stopped doing that now, my dear. I would hate to have to kill someone over you.~
@1284 = ~(smile) Actually, I might not mind that at all.~
@1285 = ~From this angle, my dear, you could be the lady Firehair herself.~
@1286 = ~...oh, just listen to me. Too much wine to<DAYNIGHT>. Again. You're right. I *am* being melodramatic.~
@1287 = ~Sometimes I think it a pity that this damn quest of yours commands so much of our attention. Realistically, I'd probably grow bored without it, but on evenings like this...~
@1288 = ~I'd almost rather forget this task completely and never rise from this spot again. A silly fantasy, yes, but I won't pretend I haven't thought it.~
@1289 = ~I've felt exactly like that for much of the last year.~
@1290 = ~Don't be ridiculous. We do have responsibilities.~
@1291 = ~Darling, you're not doing a very good job of pretending not to be romantic.~
@1292 = ~Shall we head south to Chult and disappear into its jungles to get away from everything?~
@1293 = ~Oddly enough, this is the first time in quite a while that I *haven't* felt like running away from everything.~
@1294 = ~I can believe it.~
@1295 = ~I know, I know.~
@1296 = ~No, I suppose not. I'll have to work on that, then.~
@1297 = ~I can't decide if the climate or the lack of civilization would kill me first. I suppose we shouldn't forget the savages and the wild animals.~
@1298 = ~Is it? Well, I'm glad to hear that.~
@1299 = ~Hmm. As much as I'd enjoy simply sitting here until morning... I should probably get some rest.~
@1300 = ~You're welcome to join me, <CHARNAME>. I'll even keep my hands to myself.~
@1301 = ~You're incapable of keeping your hands to yourself.~
@1302 = ~I'd rather you didn't even try.~
@1303 = ~I'll be with you in a bit.~
@1304 = ~I'd really rather sleep by myself.~
@1305 = ~Wonderful. Come on, my dear. Let's go.~
@1306 = ~Relatively speaking. Come on, my dear. Let's go.~
@1307 = ~No need to rush things, my dear.~
@1308 = ~Alright. Good night.~
@1309 = ~I'll see you tomorrow, then.~
@1310 = ~Hmm. I've been meaning to ask you something. I suppose this is as good a time as any.~
@1311 = ~What is it?~
@1312 = ~That sounds somewhat ominous.~
@1313 = ~It's a terrible time, actually.~
@1314 = ~Nothing of the sort. Were it ominous, it wouldn't keep on slipping my mind.~
@1315 = ~So intent on being prepared for tomorrow's trials, are you? Well, I'd certainly hate to interfere.~
@1316 = ~The library of Candlekeep... you're a spellcaster yourself, so I would hope that you'd have some idea of what was hidden amidst those dusty shelves.~
@1317 = ~The library of Candlekeep... given your talent for getting behind locked doors, I would hope that you'd have some idea of what was hidden amidst those dusty shelves.~
@1318 = ~The library of Candlekeep... I know you're a good deal more interested in the outdoors than old books, but even you must have some idea of what was hidden amidst those dusty shelves.~
@1319 = ~The library of Candlekeep... I know you were probably more interested in training than old books, but even you must have some idea of what was hidden amidst those dusty shelves.~
@1320 = ~It's doubtful that the monks would have held onto anything of... particular interest, but I've always wondered what secrets you people were keeping.~
@1321 = ~I did once catch a glance at a book about phylacteries, but it was gone when I went back to find it again.~
@1322 = ~If you think there were shelves full of dark magic, you're sadly mistaken.~
@1323 = ~Gorion knew well enough to keep me away from the library... I'd probably have accidentally burnt the whole thing to the ground.~
@1324 = ~Some of the old prophecies were fairly interesting. One in particular comes to mind.~
@1325 = ~I never really bothered to look through the library at all.~
@1326 = ~Those aren't quite as rare as you would think.~
@1327 = ~Not necessarily dark. I'd happily settle for anything arcane.~
@1328 = ~Ha! And what a sight that would be... no, I shouldn't laugh. I don't think you're quite clumsy enough to have managed it anyway.~
@1329 = ~Yes... I suppose we shouldn't forget that.~
@1330 = ~No? I shouldn't be surprised by now.~
@1331 = ~And even had there been anything else of note in those archives, I'm sure Gorion would have kept you away from it simply on principle.~
@1332 = ~What is that supposed to mean?~
@1333 = ~He would never have been that calculating.~
@1334 = ~It isn't as if I was ever interested in anything he had to show me anyway.~
@1335 = ~He did like to be as mysterious as possible.~
@1336 = ~He had good reason. With a heritage like mine, certain knowledge can corrupt.~
@1337 = ~Considering all the things he refused tell me, it's a wonder I'm still alive at all.~
@1338 = ~Had there been anything of note in those archives, I'm sure Gorion would have kept you away from it simply on principle.~
@1339 = ~Your blood, <CHARNAME>. Must I really spell it out for you?~
@1340 = ~And here I'd hoped for a pleasant evening. Well, if we want to survive tomorrow, we should probably get some rest anyway.~
@1341 = ~I'm surprised you can even say that with a straight face.~
@1342 = ~I don't find that exceptionally hard to believe.~
@1343 = ~But enough of this. If we want to survive tomorrow, we should probably get some rest now anyway.~
@1344 = ~And ignorance, in contrast, simply kills.~
@1345 = ~I can't deny that. In any case, if we want to survive tomorrow as well, we should probably get some rest.~
@1346 = ~A daughter of Bhaal... hmm. Even after this much time, I still can't say I'm entirely comfortable with it, but it does give a person quite a bit to think about, doesn't it?~
@1347 = ~*You're* not comfortable with *me*? At least I fight my darker urges.~
@1348 = ~What do you have to be uncomfortable with? Don't they worship gods just as dark back home?~
@1349 = ~Honestly, love, are you not used to not being the darkest thing around?~
@1350 = ~Dare I even ask what dark thoughts plague you to<DAYNIGHT>?~
@1351 = ~I'm hardly comfortable with it either, you know.~
@1352 = ~Can we about this later?~
@1353 = ~Hmm? No, no. That isn't what I meant. I think it should be clear by now that I am very, very comfortable with you, my dear.~
@1354 = ~Still, I'm glad to hear that you do. Whatever urges the blood of a dead god is giving you, they're unlikely to be conducive to your continued welfare.~
@1355 = ~Yes... I spent two years under the heel of the priests of the new Lord of Murder. Frankly, I liked them better when they were still Banites. Back then... well, things were better in general back then. For me, at least.~
@1356 = ~Not at all. I'm far from the cruelest person I've ever known. Darkness and evil and wickedness and so forth and so on... paladin's words, my dear. In any case, you know damn well that you're far from too dark for me.~
@1357 = ~I wouldn't have commented if the answer were "no," my dear.~
@1358 = ~Uncomfortable was probably the wrong word. It's not the fact that you're the daughter of Bhaal that troubles me. I... suppose if anything, it's much too close to home. My own family--~
@1359 = ~Hmm. Bhaal's daughter or not, you might not be able to understand. Not with... well, I suppose I shouldn't assume that your Harper was a soft fool, even if I really can't imagine anything else.~
@1360 = ~What does Gorion have to do with anything?~
@1361 = ~Gorion wasn't soft at all. If anything, he was cold. Distant. Unwilling to connect.~
@1362 = ~I wouldn't consider Gorion soft. He was kind, yes, but also somewhat stern. He cared deeply for me, up until the very end. That hardly makes him weak.~
@1363 = ~He was an idiot and now he's dead. What does it matter?~
@1364 = ~You'd better stop insulting him, Adrian. It's getting tiresome.~
@1365 = ~I was just thinking of my own grandfather. My mother's father, obviously. He was a distant figure when I was a child.~
@1366 = ~Cold, demanding, terrifying. A priest of Bane. Bhaal's old master, the late and unlamented god of tyranny.~
@1367 = ~Not much, I suppose. I was just thinking of my own grandfather. My mother's father, obviously. He was a distant figure when I was a child.~
@1368 = ~Prepared to play the role of judge and executioner, no doubt. Then I suppose you'll understand more than I had thought.~
@1369 = ~My grandfather was like that too, you see... cold, demanding, terrifying. A priest of Bane. Bhaal's old master, the late and unlamented god of tyranny.~
@1370 = ~I...never said it did. If Gorion was at all stern, though, maybe you'll understand. My own grandfather... he was cold, demanding, terrifying. A priest of Bane. Bhaal's old master, the late and unlamented god of tyranny.~
@1371 = ~My apologies. I was just thinking of my own grandfather. My mother's father, obviously. He was a distant figure when I was a child.~
@1372 = ~A strange way for me to put it, I suppose, since I was once his cleric also, but... well, I wasn't talking about myself.~
@1373 = ~Grandfather had clawed his way out of middle class and into the aristocracy several decades earlier, so we had money to burn. The best education available, for what it was worth. The sort of privilege I wouldn't see again, even if it was conditional upon living up to his demands.~
@1374 = ~I was devout back then, mindlessly so, perhaps, but... the Time of Troubles changed everything. For all of Faerun, yes, but... for myself as well. Once you've seen your gods in the flesh, it's... difficult to simply go back again.~
@1375 = ~I can imagine.~
@1376 = ~Difficult how?~
@1377 = ~Of course it's difficult to go back to worshipping a god who got himself killed.~
@1378 = ~I wish I remembered more of the Time of Troubles myself, all things considered.~
@1379 = ~So you just forgot to tell me that you were raised by the priesthood of Bane?~
@1380 = ~I'm really not comfortable with this topic.~
@1381 = ~When your god falls to the earth in your own city... hells, how to explain it?~
@1382 = ~That... wasn't how it happened, <CHARNAME>. At least, not for me. When your god falls to the earth in your own city... hells, how to explain it?~
@1383 = ~I honestly wish I remembered less. When your god falls to the earth in your own city... hells, how to explain it?~
@1384 = ~I... well, it wasn't exactly the priesthood, <CHARNAME>. But those memories... they're not particularly pleasant.~
@1385 = ~I try not to think about the Church of Bane at all these days. When your god falls to the earth in your own city... hells, how to explain it?~
@1386 = ~More than simply raised, <CHARNAME>. But those memories... they're not particularly pleasant.~
@1387 = ~I... suppose I'd never thought about it before. Tyranny is a fact of life, and you can only hope that your own tyrants will be easier to deal with than the ones next door: the Mulmasterites on the other side of the Moonsea, their Thayvian friends. You survive and thrive or you collapse in defeat: that's the natural order of things, but...~
@1388 = ~I saw him. Bane. Before he wandered off and got himself killed by Torm. The whole damned city knelt in front of him, and... well.~
@1389 = ~I'd have expected euphoria, to be so close to such power, in the presence of my own god, but... no. Nothing of the sort. I... I just felt so cold.~
@1390 = ~I saw him. Bane. Before he wandered off and got himself killed by Torm. The whole damned city knelt in front of him, and... hells, <CHARNAME>, I... I just felt so cold.~
@1391 = ~Cold? How so?~
@1392 = ~Adrian, if this is going to upset you, you don't need to talk about it.~
@1393 = ~I honestly feel cold just thinking about it.~
@1394 = ~That much power... I would have stood in awe, I think. Or have been green with envy.~
@1395 = ~I'm...really not very comfortable with this topic, Adrian.~
@1396 = ~I... can't really say. Heavens know, it was a while before I understood it at all. As much as I had been taught to revere him and believe in his doctrine, the sudden reality of it...~
@1397 = ~You hardly need to tell me that, <CHARNAME>. I just... you know, it took a while before I understood it at all. As much as I had been taught to revere him and believe in his doctrine, the sudden reality of it...~
@1398 = ~I...do too, truth be told. I don't know how to explain it. Heavens know, it was a while before I understood it at all. As much as I had been taught to revere him and believe in his doctrine, the sudden reality of it...~
@1399 = ~There was awe at first, <CHARNAME>. There was always awe, but mixed in with that... I honestly can't say. Heavens know, it was a while before I understood it at all. As much as I had been taught to revere him and believe in his doctrine, the sudden reality of it...~
@1400 = ~No? I... guess I should have expected that. Let's... just move on.~
@1401 = ~It was just too much. This... this was it. I'd somehow never thought about that before, never realized exactly what it meant.~
@1402 = ~Strange, perhaps, to worship something without truly understanding it, but we don't always know exactly where our spells come from.~
@1403 = ~I won't say I never realized what tyranny actually was before -- ha, how could I not? -- but the absolute form of it...~
@1404 = ~This was forever, the rest of eternity, spent on my knees in front of this...thing. The enormity of that... hells, <CHARNAME>, have you ever thought of forever?~
@1405 = ~Not in those terms, no. And I'd happily never do so again.~
@1406 = ~Who hasn't? Granted, that's quite the torture scenario you've got going there.~
@1407 = ~I'm honestly lucky if I can make myself think about tomorrow.~
@1408 = ~It's hard not to. I've had to spend a great deal of time thinking about my own divine heritage.~
@1409 = ~I've always thought that forever was only a topic of conversation for those not capable of handling today.~
@1410 = ~Really, Adrian, I'm not comfortable with this topic anymore.~
@1411 = ~I don't feel any differently. It was... probably the most profound moment of my life. Profoundly horrific, but still profound. I suppose there are reasons gods aren't supposed to walk the earth.~
@1412 = ~Isn't it just? It was... probably the most profound moment of my life. Profoundly horrific, but still profound. I suppose there are reasons gods aren't supposed to walk the earth.~
@1413 = ~(smile) My dear, sometimes I think you have the attention span of a fish.~
@1414 = ~But I guess it was just... probably the most profound moment of my life. Profoundly horrific, but still profound. I suppose there are reasons gods aren't supposed to walk the earth.~
@1415 = ~I don't blame you for that at all. Myself... it was probably the most profound moment of my life. Profoundly horrific, but still profound. I suppose there are reasons gods aren't supposed to walk the earth.~
@1416 = ~Funny, my dear. I've always thought the reverse. Myself... it was probably the most profound moment of my life. Profoundly horrific, but still profound. I suppose there are reasons gods aren't supposed to walk the earth.~
@1417 = ~I lost faith that day, shockingly enough. My awe just replaced by... revulsion. I avoided my grandfather as well as I could after that, as if he'd be able to just look at me and know.~
@1418 = ~And Bane's death... it was almost a relief. Heretical but true.~
@1419 = ~You're practically shaking! If this is going to upset you this much, you shouldn't talk about it.~
@1420 = ~And being with me makes you remember things like this?~
@1421 = ~That's what I've never understood about the dark faiths. Power, yes. Wealth and prestige, yes, but to willingly surrender yourself for all of eternity? I would never.~
@1422 = ~I think that's the only sane reaction to actually seeing a dark god in the flesh.~
@1423 = ~Am I? I... suppose that's not much of a surprise. Hmm.~
@1424 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. It's honestly not the sort of thing I'd forget in the first place. Hmm.~
@1425 = ~Well put, my lady. I suppose your own tainted blood taught you what the last ten years have taught me. Hmm.~
@1426 = ~I suppose that's one point in favor of my continued grasp on sanity. Hmm.~
@1427 = ~Very few people back home would have appreciated that story, but you... well, I guess it's something you at least have the experience to understand.~
@1428 = ~That's egocentric even for me, isn't it? And I do know it's not quite the same thing. I imagine it would be as hard for you to put into words as it was for me, but...~
@1429 = ~What is it *like*, the legacy of Bhaal? Is it a source of strength, something that can be drawn upon? Is it a madness that must be held at bay? Or do you even feel it at all? Is it just a matter of parentage like anything else?~
@1430 = ~Oh, you know how it is. A yawning abyss of madness, the voice of my psychopathic father, various other colorful metaphors to scare the children away. What about you? Are you planning on running yet? I hope not.~
@1431 = ~A source of strength, I'd say. Dangerous, possibly, but I've always been able to tame it in the past and I'm not going to run from it now.~
@1432 = ~A madness, a quiet bloodlust I can't quite silence, even if I keep myself from acting upon it. There's no strength there.~
@1433 = ~It's really not as much of an issue as people tend to make of it. At least, it hasn't been so far.~
@1434 = ~That isn't an acceptable topic of conversation, Adrian. Even with you.~
@1435 = ~No, I'm not. You wield your wit like a sword and shield, <CHARNAME>. But I suppose that still tells me enough.~
@1436 = ~And I'm glad for it... you deserve better than to be destroyed by the machinations of a dead god.~
@1437 = ~Born to bloodshed and tempered by adversity, is it? Just be careful, <CHARNAME>. Please. You're playing with fire, and you deserve better than to be destroyed by the machinations of a dead god.~
@1438 = ~I wouldn't be so sure. The walls you've built against it serve you against other problems as well.~
@1439 = ~Perhaps that's even more noteworthy than if you were drawing strength from the god's power itself. The power you're using is yours alone. Honestly, <CHARNAME>, that only impresses me more.~
@1440 = ~That's lucky, if a bit surprising. Hopefully it continues to hold true. You deserve better than to be destroyed by the machinations of a dead god.~
@1441 = ~No, I can understand that. Forgive me the presumption, <CHARNAME>.~
@1442 = ~Once this is over, assuming we live through it... hmm.~
@1443 = ~Hmm?~
@1444 = ~Are you suddenly thinking about settling down?~
@1445 = ~At this point, I find that highly unlikely.~
@1446 = ~'Assuming'? When did you become such a pessimist?~
@1447 = ~I wish you'd stop breaking off mid-sentence as if you're trying to decide exactly how much you want to share.~
@1448 = ~Can we talk about this later?~
@1449 = ~Every time you open your mouth, your chance of living through it decreases substantially.~
@1450 = ~Ah... no. Not exactly. It's a little soon for that.~
@1451 = ~Stranger things have happened.~
@1452 = ~A pessimist? I'm trying to be realistic. For the first time in my life, perhaps.~
@1453 = ~Oh. Don't think anything of it, <CHARNAME>. Old habit, I suppose.~
@1454 = ~A pessimist? No, I'm trying to be realistic.~
@1455 = ~Old habit, I suppose.~
@1456 = ~Fine. I won't make that mistake again.~
@1457 = ~I've tried not to think about it that much, but... I'm in exile now, aren't I? I suppose there's nothing much to go back to at this point anyway, but even if there were...~
@1458 = ~I'm not sure what to make of that.~
@1459 = ~Haven't you spent about half your life away as it is?~
@1460 = ~Don't worry about it. We can still build a new life elsewhere.~
@1461 = ~Don't worry about it. You're young. You still have plenty of time to build a new life elsewhere.~
@1462 = ~I know the feeling.~
@1463 = ~Don't tell me you're missing that frozen tyrannical rock of yours.~
@1464 = ~Why do you need to make anything of it at all?~
@1465 = ~I have, and thank all the gods for that, but... it's strange, finally being completely, irrevocably away. Stranger than I ever thought it would be, though I suppose I never much considered the possibility at all until it became reality.~
@1466 = ~I'd like that, I think, but... it's strange, finally being completely, irrevocably away. Stranger than I ever thought it would be, though I suppose I never much considered the possibility at all until it became reality.~
@1467 = ~Relatively young, but... it's strange, finally being completely, irrevocably away. Stranger than I ever thought it would be, though I suppose I never much considered the possibility at all until it became reality.~
@1468 = ~I suppose you do. For me, it's strange, finally being completely, irrevocably away. Stranger than I ever thought it would be, though I suppose I never much considered the possibility at all until it became reality.~
@1469 = ~Missing? I don't know. It's just... strange, finally being completely, irrevocably away. Stranger than I ever thought it would be, though I suppose I never much considered the possibility at all until it became reality.~
@1470 = ~I can't help it. I guess it's just... strange, finally being completely, irrevocably away. Stranger than I ever thought it would be, though I suppose I never much considered the possibility at all until it became reality.~
@1471 = ~I don't know if it's the same for you, being away from Candlekeep.~
@1472 = ~I probably could go back at this point. There's just nothing much to go back to.~
@1473 = ~I spent my whole childhood wanting to get away, but when the gates were finally barred to me... no, the feeling isn't pleasant.~
@1474 = ~It is. I would give anything to go back to the way things were before.~
@1475 = ~I've put Candlekeep behind me entirely. I hardly think about it at all.~
@1476 = ~At least I don't have to worry about being hunted by the monks of Oghma.~
@1477 = ~Yes, I understand that as well.~
@1478 = ~It doesn't even matter that you don't necessarily want to go back, it's just... the fact that you can't, I suppose. And beyond that...~
@1479 = ~Anything, my dear?~
@1480 = ~No, I'm happier now than I was before, but...~
@1481 = ~I'd need to go back more than simply a year or two.~
@1482 = ~I wish I could do the same. Hmm.~
@1483 = ~...~
@1484 = ~No, I guess you don't. Hunted by the rest of the world, perhaps, but that's neither here nor there.~
@1485 = ~It's funny, isn't it? So many people value freedom above anything else, but me... I'm not even sure that I like it.~
@1486 = ~I think your problem is purpose rather than freedom. You need meaning in your life beyond me and my affairs.~
@1487 = ~That's completely nonsensical. There's nothing more precious.~
@1488 = ~So used to oppression that you can't function without it?~
@1489 = ~Well, if you'd rather go terrorize the Heartlands into submission, I'll put it on our to-do list.~
@1490 = ~Freedom is hardly something you have to worry about. Not with me ordering you around.~
@1491 = ~Heh. Perhaps. I suppose after that nonsense in Baldur's Gate, the Iron Throne wouldn't be interested in our service?~
@1492 = ~But I jest. I hope. I'm not actually sure that what I want is a new master.~
@1493 = ~Perhaps. Still, I'm not actually sure that what I want is a new master.~
@1494 = ~Given how many other things are on your to-do list, I suppose it may take a while to reach that one.~
@1495 = ~Heh. Don't make promises you don't intend to keep, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@1496 = ~That's... strangely comforting, truth be told, though it's not quite the same thing. My dear, you can't really afford to come after me if I run.~
@1497 = ~It's not quite the same thing. My <PRO_LADYLORD>, you can't really afford to come after me if I run.~
@1498 = ~There's no point in obsessing over it, though. No direction left to take but forward.~
@1499 = ~It's banal and cliche when put into words, but... sometimes I envy your conviction. The world knocks you down again and again, and you simply come back each time, stronger than ever, to the hells with anyone's rules except your own.~
@1500 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you have any idea how attractive that is?~
@1501 = ~Don't build me up to be something I'm not, Adrian. I have questions too. At least as many as you do.~
@1502 = ~So I've been told more times than I can count.~
@1503 = ~You struggle back to your feet or you collapse, and the more often it happens, the easier it gets.~
@1504 = ~Given that I can't get you into my bed, it can't be very attractive at all.~
@1505 = ~Don't sell yourself short, Adrian. You're stronger than you think.~
@1506 = ~I don't mind hearing it again, my dear. You're welcome to indulge me.~
@1507 = ~Perhaps, but you handle them a grace and dignity that is well beyond your years... no, don't deny it. False modesty really doesn't become you.~
@1508 = ~Ha! Well, let me add a couple more numbers to that scoresheet of yours, <CHARNAME>, because it really is true.~
@1509 = ~Unless you're pinned onto the ground, at least. Ahh, but I'm tired of being morose about this.~
@1510 = ~Is that your angle, my dear? As... enjoyable as it would be to remedy that right here and now, perhaps that's a discussion best saved until tonight.~
@1511 = ~Maybe. I used to think so, but now... well, things make less sense in general. Let's just move on.~
@1512 = ~And I shall. In great detail. Over a few glasses of wine and a fine meal -- assuming we can even find one in this country -- and... mmm. What were we even talking about?~
@1513 = ~It must be easy for you. You wave your hand around and the whole damn world bows down in front of you.~
@1514 = ~Myself included, but hells... I've spent my entire life bowing. Why stop now?~
@1515 = ~Oh, not this again. What did I do this time?~
@1516 = ~Aren't you a bit too old for temper tantrums? Just calm down.~
@1517 = ~Do you honestly think the world bows down in front of me? Irenicus certainly didn't. I have the scars to prove it, if you'd care to take a look.~
@1518 = ~Do you always have to attack me whenever you're upset about something?~
@1519 = ~You're certainly right about the whole world bowing in front of me. You never had a problem with that before.~
@1520 = ~If you can't keep a courteous tongue in your mouth, we're done here.~
@1521 = ~You... nothing. That's not the point. I... I don't even know what the point is.~
@1522 = ~Temper tantums? Well, isn't that a lovely way to frame it. I... I don't even know anymore.~
@1523 = ~You... no, I know that. I...~
@1524 = ~Is that what I'm doing? I... maybe it is.~
@1525 = ~Oh, am I having problems now? Well, wonderful. I... I don't even know anymore.~
@1526 = ~I... you're right, I don't.~
@1527 = ~Fine. Maybe that's for the best.~
@1528 = ~You don't mean that. Whatever is bothering you, just tell me.~
@1529 = ~Oh, here we go again. Ever with the temper tantrums.~
@1530 = ~Maybe it is.~
@1531 = ~Look at me, lashing out. But I suppose that's what I'm best at. It's the way I've handled my problems for the last two years, no use trying something new.~
@1532 = ~I doubt it's gotten you anywhere in the past and it's certainly not getting you anywhere now.~
@1533 = ~Only the last two years? I sincerely doubt that.~
@1534 = ~For once, just drop the nonsense and tell me what's bothering you.~
@1535 = ~Don't bother. I'm not interested anyway. Just get lost.~
@1536 = ~*Nothing* has gotten me much of anywhere in the past, <CHARNAME>, I...~
@1537 = ~Probably... probably not. I...~
@1538 = ~The nonsense? What am I without the nonsense?~
@1539 = ~Fine. To the hells with you too, <CHARNAME>.~
@1540 = ~I am not being remotely coherent, am I? I just... have you ever woken up and found yourself wondering if everything you ever thought you knew was somehow... backwards?~
@1541 = ~Well, I woke up one morning and found out I was a daughter of Bhaal, if that counts.~
@1542 = ~I hope you're not suddenly losing it because you've decided you can never truly know if your hand is really your hand. I don't do metaphysics.~
@1543 = ~I wish you could have started this conversation like that in the first place.~
@1544 = ~That's nothing to be afraid of. It's better to face these questions than to live your life ignoring them.~
@1545 = ~Well, it isn't as if everything you've ever known isn't a crazy mess.~
@1546 = ~This isn't the time for self-doubt. Remorse and regret... that isn't what I fell in love with.~
@1547 = ~Hmm. With that damn Harper keeping secrets, making you believe you were something you weren't... maybe you could understand.~
@1548 = ~What? No. I've little enough interest in meaningless questions. They may be entertaining thought exercises, but... no, I'm not in the mood for that sort of nonsense.~
@1549 = ~I'm... sorry. You're right, but...~
@1550 = ~Well, it's a hell of a lot easier ignoring them.~
@1551 = ~No. No, sometimes I don't even know what you fell in love with.~
@1552 = ~You're really not helping.~
@1553 = ~Two years, <CHARNAME>. I spent two years telling myself to be strong enough to cope with a situation I didn't like, but...  what a damned joke in the end.~
@1554 = ~Was there any strength there at all? No, I was just too damn frightened to run. I...really can't hide from that anymore. I let myself be treated as badly as the slaves we were moving.~
@1555 = ~I talked myself into believing I was showing conviction. Commitment. How utterly pathetic.~
@1556 = ~And it didn't bother you at all? Trading slaves?~
@1557 = ~You did what you had to do. That's nothing to get worked up about. They terrorized you into it.~
@1558 = ~You dwell on things like this and it'll destroy you, Adrian. Just move on.~
@1559 = ~You're capable of conviction and commitment, Adrian. You've proven as much. You don't need to let your moments of cowardice destroy you.~
@1560 = ~That is pretty pathetic. I hear nonsense like this and I wonder why I put up with you at all.~
@1561 = ~It... it did. Not as much as it would you, no doubt, but I've never had a taste for the business. I think that's why they finally assigned me to those slaving caravans. Just another cruel jest.~
@1562 = ~They did. Oh, did they ever. And I just let them. For two years, I just let them. It took my whole city getting razed to the ground before I could even bring myself to run.~
@1563 = ~How am I even supposed to?~
@1564 = ~No, I know that's a stupid question. I move on because I have to. If I've learned nothing else over the years, I've learned how to survive. I just...~
@1565 = ~Am I? I started chasing this quest of yours because the thought of having no goal at all was terrifying, and... gods, I may have fallen for you somewhere along the line, but...~
@1566 = ~Well, you certainly don't have to.~
@1567 = ~This is idiotic. You shouldn't dwell on nonsense like this. Just move on.~
@1568 = ~Adrian, you're capable of conviction, and I don't like this defeatist attitude.~
@1569 = ~And I don't intend to. Go cry to someone else from now on.~
@1570 = ~I don't think I even realized it until I finally hit rock bottom. I've spent so much time blaming myself for getting into that mess in the first place, but... hells, I'd been a slave long before the Melvauntians clapped me in chains.~
@1571 = ~You... you probably don't want to hear this nonsense.~
@1572 = ~It's hardly nonsense. Stop trying to pretend that the things that bother you don't matter.~
@1573 = ~You're wrong. I've been hoping you'd finally realize this for quite some time.~
@1574 = ~I want to help you. It's not like I haven't always known you had some serious issues.~
@1575 = ~It's not exactly pleasant, but you obviously need to talk about it.~
@1576 = ~You're right. I really don't.~
@1577 = ~But they're not supposed to bother me. I'm not supposed to care.~
@1578 = ~If you thought so little of me, it's a wonder you let me travel with you at all. I'm not supposed to be bothered by things like this... I'm not supposed to care.~
@1579 = ~I'm not supposed to be bothered by things like this... I'm not supposed to care. Just... just leave me alone for a bit. Please.~
@1580 = ~Do I? I don't even know what to say. I'm not supposed to need to talk about it. I'm not supposed to care.~
@1581 = ~Then I'll leave you alone.~
@1582 = ~I... can't talk about this. Not right now. Just... just leave me alone for a bit. Please.~
@1583 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I shouldn't have dropped something like... well, like that on you the other day. You must think I'm completely insane.~
@1584 = ~Come, now. You know full well I've thought that for quite some time.~
@1585 = ~You should have told me you were feeling like that long before yesterday.~
@1586 = ~Are you feeling better now, at least?~
@1587 = ~The next time you attack me like that, I have a Power Word Silence with your name on it.~
@1588 = ~Attack me like that again, and I'll hit you over the head with a blunt object.~
@1589 = ~You can apologize later. We're a bit busy right now.~
@1590 = ~Heh. Still, I don't like... demonstrating it so convincingly.~
@1591 = ~Maybe. I'm... not sure I even really knew.~
@1592 = ~Yes, I think so.~
@1593 = ~My lady, what a terribly irresponsible use of magic that would be!~
@1594 = ~Better than a sharp one, I suppose. I'll... keep that in mind.~
@1595 = ~It's a hard thing to admit to. Two years of my life, wasted. And perhaps... perhaps even more than that. A bit too late for sudden moralizing, but...~
@1596 = ~Hells, maybe we're all just playing follow the leader, pitiful dogs begging for scraps at the master's table, letting ourselves be played against each other for the amusement of our glorious overlords, to weak to be able to stand on our own.~
@1597 = ~I've always saved my disdain for the rest of the world, but... perhaps we're just as worthy.~
@1598 = ~I think that goes for your glorious overlords as well. Fear of others, fear of failure, fear of death. They let those fears consume them until nothing remains but ambition.~
@1599 = ~Better to assert your own will, even at the cost of everything, than allow yourself to be trampled into the mud. I can't say I disagree.~
@1600 = ~Weakness disguised as strength. If there's such a thing as true evil, perhaps that's what it would be.~
@1601 = ~And that's enough tormented philosophizing for one <DAYNIGHT>. At least you're not still screaming at me, but I hate to see you so morose. Care for a candlelit dinner and then... well, wherever the night takes us?~
@1602 = ~You're not going to suddenly start having moral dilemmas whenever I decide to do something slightly entertaining, are you?~
@1603 = ~All? Possibly. I don't know. A tyrant not motivated by fear, one who's true to his or her own convictions... that would be a person to admire, perhaps, but...~
@1604 = ~And the people who have that conviction... well, I suppose they're the ones to truly admire.~
@1605 = ~True evil... that's still such a strange concept, but... perhaps. I suppose that's where we make the mistakes that haunt us.~
@1606 = ~Mmm, is self-indulgent melancholy considered romantic in this part of Faerun? I'm quite sure the night can take us wherever you're willing, my dear, but... hmm.~
@1607 = ~A moral dilemma? Is that what this is? As long as you don't do something insane, my dear, I really couldn't care less what horrible, horrible things you do. Beyond that...~
@1608 = ~I honestly don't know how you do it, <CHARNAME>. Leader of a party of dysfunctional madmen, committed to an impossible task... I would fall apart at the seams. Obviously.~
@1609 = ~So I've noticed.~
@1610 = ~It's not like I have a choice. I'm not sure what happens if I don't get my soul back, and I'm not interested in finding out.~
@1611 = ~It's not like I have a choice. If I give up, Imoen pays the price.~
@1612 = ~If I fell apart, I wouldn't be able to put myself back together. I suppose that keeps me going as much as anything else.~
@1613 = ~I wish I could just lose control entirely for a bit. Just lie back and let things play out as they will.~
@1614 = ~You honestly think I'm still sane? I've been out of control since Gorion was murdered.~
@1615 = ~It's a matter of conviction. I know I'm going to win. Falling apart isn't an option.~
@1616 = ~That's... rather evasive of you, my dear.~
@1617 = ~Neither am I, my dear. Neither am I. Selfish of me to toss my own minor issues at you when the stakes are already so high.~
@1618 = ~The things we do for love, is it?~
@1619 = ~I can sympathize with that. I wish it were as much a motivator for me, but... (sigh)~
@1620 = ~And I'd like to be able to take up that responsibility for you, if only for a bit. If you ever want me to... well, all you have to do is ask.~
@1621 = ~You may be a whirlwind, my dear, but you do get things done. Don't sell yourself short.~
@1622 = ~To imagine defeat is to accept it, hmm? Maybe that is the key.~
@1623 = ~I think the very first thing I ever noticed about you was your strength, <CHARNAME>. Shocking, I know. Not your beauty, not even your mind, but the aura of command about you.~
@1624 = ~Perhaps it's a result of your divine heritage, perhaps not. Whatever its origin, it's... intoxicating.~
@1625 = ~I'd say what the first thing I noticed about you was, but that would be telling.~
@1626 = ~I'm just as mortal as you are, Adrian.~
@1627 = ~Is that all I am to you? The strongest master available?~
@1628 = ~If you're trying to seduce me, that's really not quite necessary.~
@1629 = ~Still attracted to power, then? I'm glad to hear it.~
@1630 = ~My sickeningly desperate pleas for help, no doubt. But we're all human, aren't we? Or half-elven, at least.~
@1631 = ~I never said that you weren't, <CHARNAME>. These masks we wear...~
@1632 = ~What? No. I'd never have agreed to this if you were just something to cling to. You deserve better than that. We both do.~
@1633 = ~But these masks we wear. You may be one of the strongest people I know, but I suppose we're all human in the end. Or half-elven, at least.~
@1634 = ~Shall we call a break and finish this conversation with you in my arms, then? I can't say I'd mind that at all.~
@1635 = ~Ahh, but these masks we wear. You may be one of the strongest people I know, but I suppose  we're all human in the end. Or half-elven, at least.~
@1636 = ~Always, my dear. But these masks we wear. You may be one of the strongest people I know, but I suppose  we're all human in the end. Or half-elven, at least.~
@1637 = ~I... think I finally understand that now. Or accept it, rather. A little bit late, perhaps, but I suppose that can't be helped.~
@1638 = ~I... know you've been having trouble sleeping, <CHARNAME>. If you... if you want to talk at some point, I'm willing to listen.~
@1639 = ~Thank you. I think I'd like that.~
@1640 = ~So you finally don't plan on lunging at the first sign of weakness? I never thought I'd see the day.~
@1641 = ~You watch me sleep, do you?~
@1642 = ~If I start talking now, I don't know if I'll ever be able to stop.~
@1643 = ~I appreciate the thought, but I'm quite all right.~
@1644 = ~Just because you're suddenly turning into a conflicted sentimental mess doesn't mean that I am. Indulge in weakness if you want. Just don't expect me to follow suit.~
@1645 = ~I'm glad to hear it. We've probably spent more than enough time talking at the moment, but... do keep the offer in mind.~
@1646 = ~A rare occurrence indeed, I know. No, you... the rules are different for you, <CHARNAME>. You should know that by now. Do keep the offer in mind.~
@1647 = ~I... think I've noticed that with myself. I'm not really sure if that's a bad thing. I won't try to force you to tell me anything, but... do keep the offer in mind.~
@1648 = ~Shamelessly. Jests aside, though, keep the offer in mind.~
@1649 = ~Are you? At this point, I can't quite believe it. I won't try to force you to tell me anything, but... do keep the offer in mind.~
@1650 = ~I see. Fine. If you don't want to take me up on the offer, I'll accept that. I understand your reasons as well as anyone could. But if you think I'm going to sit back and let you insult me, you're very, very wrong.~
@1651 = ~Are we understood?~
@1652 = ~You haven't lost your spine after all, apparently. Maybe... maybe this isn't such a terrible idea after all.~
@1653 = ~Shall we agree to disagree, then? Fine. Just don't bring it up again.~
@1654 = ~The only thing I understand here is that you've lost your nerve entirely.~
@1655 = ~You can trust me, <CHARNAME>. I'm not going to betray you. Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't dare.~
@1656 = ~I won't try to force you to tell me anything, but... do keep the offer in mind.~
@1657 = ~Fair enough.~
@1658 = ~I'm... sorry you feel that way.~
@1659 = ~You don't mind me taking another look through your spellbooks, do you?~
@1660 = ~Of course not.~
@1661 = ~Just don't take notes in them this time.~
@1662 = ~If you've got improvements to suggest, you know I like to hear them.~
@1663 = ~Sometimes I think you only love me for my magic.~
@1664 = ~Hands off. Those are mine.~
@1665 = ~Wonderful. Thank you.~
@1666 = ~That was a spelling correction, hardly an essay on arcane theory.~
@1667 = ~<CHARNAME>, you know full well that you've as decent a grasp as anyone I know. Minus a handful of dark wizards I wish I weren't acquainted with.~
@1668 = ~Don't be ridiculous, <CHARNAME>. Granted, it is a nice advantage.~
@1669 = ~You might as well just let me. I'll complain until you do.~
@1670 = ~You know, I've never understood arcane preparation. I never had the knack for it, as much as my uncle tried to teach me. But you make it look good.~
@1671 = ~Of course I make it look good.~
@1672 = ~As long as you stop trying to distract me when I'm studying.~
@1673 = ~Honestly, I'd rather have your type of magic.~
@1674 = ~Come back here. I can't kiss you when you have your nose in my spellbook.~
@1675 = ~It's a precious thing, you know... this sort of rapport. So many tend to guard their spellbooks from the eyes of others.~
@1676 = ~Well, we've shared a great deal more than mere spells.~
@1677 = ~I've long since realized that trying to guard it from you is useless.~
@1678 = ~Mages are jealous people... don't ever forget that.~
@1679 = ~I don't blame them. I can't kiss you when you have your nose in my spellbook.~
@1680 = ~You make a great many other things look good as well, my dear.~
@1681 = ~Try? I do no such thing, my dear. I'm quite sure I've always succeeded.~
@1682 = ~Well, I'm not trading, my dear.~
@1683 = ~Mmm, a suggestion like that... how could I refuse?~
@1684 = ~I suppose that is a valid point.~
@1685 = ~Ah... my dear, if my eyes ever roam, you're well within your rights to pluck them out of my head.~
@1686 = ~I can't help but think that Tymora tossed a coin when you were born... and it landed on its edge. So lucky and yet unlucky at the same time.~
@1687 = ~Daughter of murder, gifted with sorcery. At least it should help you win in the end.~
@1688 = ~And trained by a wizard as well. Most sorcerers aren't so lucky.~
@1689 = ~Jealous, are you?~
@1690 = ~Much of that applies to you as well, you know.~
@1691 = ~Sometimes I think you only love me for my sorcery.~
@1692 = ~My magic is hardly the only thing I rely upon. (smile)~
@1693 = ~No, I suppose that isn't particularly common. For once... well, for once I ought to be grateful for your old Harper.~
@1694 = ~A little bit, I have to admit.~
@1695 = ~I would hardly consider myself a daughter of murder, but no... you do have a point.~
@1696 = ~No... you're quite welcome to rely upon mine as well.~
@1697 = ~There's nothing quite like a sorcerer with full mastery and understanding to even the odds, and the time that a wizard would spend studying afterwards...~
@1698 = ~Well. (smile) I'm sure we could find more interesting ways to spend it.~
@1699 = ~...please tell me I'm not blushing now.~
@1700 = ~Do at least try to take things seriously, Adrian.~
@1701 = ~Shameless. I do love that.~
@1702 = ~Careful. With a comment like that, I may well decide that we're done working for the <DAYNIGHT> here and now.~
@1703 = ~Watching you... I've never been that impressed with sorcery before... too much of a traditionalist, perhaps, but you really are magnificent, <CHARNAME>.~
@1704 = ~And don't you ever forget it.~
@1705 = ~And a wizard's study suits you.~
@1706 = ~We do complement each other well.~
@1707 = ~You hardly need to seduce me, you know.~
@1708 = ~Ha! I assure you, <CHARNAME>, it becomes you.~
@1709 = ~I'm the very image of sobriety, my dear.~
@1710 = ~Yes... I have noticed that.~
@1711 = ~Ahh... don't tease me with such promises, my dear.~
@1712 = ~My dear, how could I?~
@1713 = ~Well, as long as you don't mind that I spend half the evening with my nose in a book.~
@1714 = ~In more ways than one.~
@1715 = ~Mmm, no... I would assume not.~
@1716 = ~Sometimes I'm amazed that either of us still believes in anything at all. My faith in the gods has been shaken more than once, and you...~
@1717 = ~You've suffered at a god's hands far more intimately than I have.~
@1718 = ~It isn't always easy, but neither are most things that are worthwhile.~
@1719 = ~Sometimes I think my faith is the only thing that holds me together.~
@1720 = ~They struggle as much as we do sometimes. That makes me love them more, not less.~
@1721 = ~Nobody is more aware of the gods' power and importance than I am, at least.~
@1722 = ~My suffering only makes me treasure the cause of justice even more.~
@1723 = ~My suffering only makes me treasure the cause of freedom even more.~
@1724 = ~I believe in power. Bhaal's blood gives it me, as does my own deity's will.~
@1725 = ~Yes, I'm quite sure I've heard this from you before.~
@1726 = ~It is a constant to cling to, I suppose. That is... increasingly important.~
@1727 = ~You're more generous than I, <CHARNAME>. It only makes me trust them less.~
@1728 = ~No... I suppose you have a point.~
@1729 = ~Well... at least you're consistent, I suppose.~
@1730 = ~Great power with an even greater price... for you, perhaps it's worth it.~
@1731 = ~Still... shameful as it may be to even ask it, do you never waver?~
@1732 = ~If we never questioned our faith, what real worth would it have?~
@1733 = ~Occasionally I wonder if I'm on the right path, but the will of my deity... never.~
@1734 = ~More than I care to admit, but my deity hasn't abandoned me yet. I suppose that's something.~
@1735 = ~No, never. My convictions are absolute.~
@1736 = ~Still... do you never waver?~
@1737 = ~For ourselves or for our gods? Some prefer mindless fanaticism, but... well. Perhaps you have a point.~
@1738 = ~When you can take everything the multiverse throws at you without flinching away... I suppose that's how you know your path is right.~
@1739 = ~Yes... all too often, I feel like that as well.~
@1740 = ~I envy you that, my dear. I really do.~
@1741 = ~Trust without question isn't trust at all, is it? Maybe you have a point.~
@1742 = ~Pray everyday and your spells still come? If only it were that easy for all of us.~
@1743 = ~I know you may be a musician, <CHARNAME>, but do you really need to wander around Amn with an orchestra in your bag?~
@1744 = ~Why exactly are you going through my bags?~
@1745 = ~Hey, careful! You'll break that!~
@1746 = ~It's a harp, two flutes, a guitar, and a tambourine. That's hardly an orchestra.~
@1747 = ~Coming from a man who travels with a private library, that's pretty rich.~
@1748 = ~I might have tossed something into it last night without thinking.~
@1749 = ~I will not. I'm perfectly capable of handling an instrument. It's only the harps that tend to spontaneously go up in flames.~
@1750 = ~True. At least we don't need to travel with a coterie of slaves to carry your pump organ like they do in Thay.~
@1751 = ~Though that's a rather amusing image if you're ever interested.~
@1752 = ~I'd say that those at least have utility, but I think you might kill me.~
@1753 = ~You do know I love your music, though, don't you?~
@1754 = ~Of course I do.~
@1755 = ~It's nice to hear you say it.~
@1756 = ~And you, my dear, have a beautiful voice. I wish you'd sing for me someday.~
@1757 = ~And as much as I enjoy the sound of your voice, I wish you'd come over here and use your lips for something else.~
@1758 = ~Mm, good.~
@1759 = ~Heh. Maybe.~
@1760 = ~As my lady commands.~
@1761 = ~I'm honestly somewhat surprised that your precious order hasn't thrown you out for this yet, <CHARNAME>.~
@1762 = ~You sound almost unhappy about that.~
@1763 = ~My order actually respects its members, as difficult as that may be for you to understand.~
@1764 = ~For falling in love? That's hardly a crime, Adrian.~
@1765 = ~Honestly, so am I.~
@1766 = ~Unhappy? No, not exactly.~
@1767 = ~Point taken.~
@1768 = ~Yes, but your choice of lover?~
@1769 = ~And yet you would risk it anyway?~
@1770 = ~I suppose sometimes I can't help but wonder if this isn't part of some diabolical paladin plot. It isn't as if the reverse has never happened.~
@1771 = ~I would be more worried about my paladinhood were I truly trying to manipulate you like that.~
@1772 = ~I don't doubt it has. At least I don't need to worry about that.~
@1773 = ~I'm quite sure my order barely knows you exist.~
@1774 = ~Adrian, I've been convinced for quite some time now that you're only evil by association. If even that. My order would trust my judgement in such things.~
@1775 = ~Paladins don't *make* diabolical plans. That's part of the definition of paladinhood.~
@1776 = ~That's...actually probably true.~
@1777 = ~Well, if it doesn't bother you, I suppose I might as well let it drop.~
@1778 = ~Indeed, because all I need in my life right now is a blackguard of Cyric.~
@1779 = ~Nothing would make me happier than that.~
@1780 = ~...well. I suppose that's not quite true.~
@1781 = ~...that's still quite some association to overlook, my lady.~
@1782 = ~Heh. Forgive the quaint phrasing then, my lady.~
@1783 = ~I'm beginning to think that I have a type.~
@1784 = ~Secretive, shadowy, beautiful?~
@1785 = ~If you've got a torrid love affair with one of my sister Bhaalspawn to share, you really should have told me earlier.~
@1786 = ~I may be a rogue, but I'm not an assassin.~
@1787 = ~What are you talking about?~
@1788 = ~And quick, talented, and dangerous to know.~
@1789 = ~Ha. No, my dear. But you're a creature of the shadows, born and bred.~
@1790 = ~Just thinking aloud, my dear.~
@1791 = ~Still, there's nothing quite like the skillful hands of a thief...~
@1792 = ~Are you asking for a massage?~
@1793 = ~Care for a demonstration?~
@1794 = ~I don't know. A wizard's skillful tongue...~
@1795 = ~As you demonstrate quite often yourself.~
@1796 = ~Skillful hands, is it? I could always hit you, you know.~
@1797 = ~Oh... definitely, yes.~
@1798 = ~Mmm, we might as well find out...~
@1799 = ~Is that a request, <CHARNAME>?~
@1800 = ~...fine, I suppose I walked into that one.~
@1801 = ~If someone had told me a year ago that I would be falling for a ranger...~
@1802 = ~You would have murdered him?~
@1803 = ~At least I'm not an elf. Then where would you be?~
@1804 = ~Is that humor in your voice? Perhaps there's hope for you yet.~
@1805 = ~...a year ago? No. I'd probably have just upended a mug of mead over his head and assigned him double guard shifts.~
@1806 = ~Even more bemused than I already am.~
@1807 = ~Laugh or cry, <CHARNAME>.~
@1808 = ~I could do with a bit less rescuing of the weak and pathetic, but wandering around in the woodlands, almost alone but for you... I like it more than I thought I would.~
@1809 = ~My love, you should try to decide whether you're aiming for condescending or romantic before you open your mouth.~
@1810 = ~I'm glad to hear it. That was very nearly romantic of you.~
@1811 = ~Enough rescuing and one day maybe you'll like even that part too.~
@1812 = ~I enjoy the sound of your voice almost as much as you do, Adrian, but I wish you'd come over here and use your lips for something else.~
@1813 = ~Ha! Mercy, my lady... I can't help myself.~
@1814 = ~Mmm, I suppose I'll blame the elven blood.~
@1815 = ~Don't hang your hopes on it, <CHARNAME>. I don't want to disappoint you.~
@1816 = ~Mmm, as my lady commands.~
@1817 = ~<CHARNAME>, I think you're out of bat guano again.~
@1818 = ~Just because I'm a druid doesn't mean you can raid my bags for spell components whenever you want to.~
@1819 = ~I never had any. I stopped stocking it the last time you stole it all.~
@1820 = ~Really? I'll have to get some more, I suppose.~
@1821 = ~Boundaries, boundaries. Fine, I'll keep my hands to myself.~
@1822 = ~Wonderful.~
@1823 = ~I've never been much of a woodsman, but you do know I like this, right? Wandering around in the forests, almost alone but for you...~
@1824 = ~I don't think your approval has anything to do with the forest.~
@1825 = ~...I never said it did, my dear.~
@1826 = ~I should thank you for saving my life in that last battle, <CHARNAME>.~
@1827 = ~You sound a bit bemused.~
@1828 = ~You were well out of danger, you know.~
@1829 = ~As if I'm going to let some ruffian cut my sorcerer to pieces.~
@1830 = ~As if I'm going to let some ruffian cut my wizard to pieces.~
@1831 = ~A bit, I suppose. I'm used to relying upon armed warriors, but I've never before really felt like thanking one for doing his or her job.~
@1832 = ~In the middle of battle, there's no such thing.~
@1833 = ~Spin it however you'd like, my dear.~
@1834 = ~A warrior lady... it's a bit strange, even now. I suppose the only fighters I'm used to these days are Zhentilar scum, but still...~
@1835 = ~I take too much pride in my skill to waste it on a common military.~
@1836 = ~Not all military men and women are rampaging psychopaths, you know.~
@1837 = ~Please, no magical elitism to<DAYNIGHT>, Adrian.~
@1838 = ~And does my skill awe the great sorcerer?~
@1839 = ~And does my skill awe the mighty wizard?~
@1840 = ~As you should.~
@1841 = ~All the ones I've ever met are. Or close enough. On both sides.~
@1842 = ~Ha, I'd be afraid you might kill me.~
@1843 = ~...more than I'd care to admit.~
@1844 = ~Just... be careful, <CHARNAME>. Please.~
@1845 = ~Murder me in my sleep if I ever start waxing poetic, but some <DAYNIGHT>s I suppose I can't help but come close.~
@1846 = ~Ah... do I finally get my love poetry now? I knew it would only be a matter of time.~
@1847 = ~Would you prefer poison or a knife? Or shall I just smother you, my dear?~
@1848 = ~Do you have any moods at all besides black and quixotic? At the same time, no less!~
@1849 = ~What's on your mind?~
@1850 = ~I'm sure this can wait.~
@1851 = ~If I tried to write you poetry, I'm sure you would flee in horror. Best not to inflict that madness upon either of us.~
@1852 = ~Hmm, I suppose I wouldn't have room to complain, whichever you chose. I've more than enough experience with the first two, but smothering sounds new and exciting.~
@1853 = ~I certainly hope so. Hmm.~
@1854 = ~Besides senseless romanticism?~
@1855 = ~No, I don't really intend to sing your praises or anything of the sort, but... ha. Were I another man, I'd play the role of the chivalrous prince, no doubt. I'd lay flowers at your feet and shower you with a kingdom's worth of jewelry.~
@1856 = ~Now, wouldn't that be a sight.~
@1857 = ~Prince charming wouldn't suit you, my dear. Best stick with the roles you know.~
@1858 = ~Did you really bring flowers? This I have to see.~
@1859 = ~I think I'd enjoy you in the role of the chivalrous prince for once.~
@1860 = ~Quite the sight. If you didn't want to live to see the dawn.~
@1861 = ~Drop the act, Adrian. What are you trying to say?~
@1862 = ~That shouldn't be particularly hard.~
@1863 = ~Heh. No, I didn't. What would we do with them anyway? Drop them on the side of the road and watch them rot?~
@1864 = ~You'd get bored by it even more quickly than I would, I suspect.~
@1865 = ~Ha! I suppose we might as well skip the flowers, then. What would we do with them anyway? Drop them on the side of the road and watch them rot?~
@1866 = ~Ahh... you really do have no patience at all sometimes, <CHARNAME>.~
@1867 = ~But no... no flowers, and as for gems... well, they took everything when I was captured. Everything of significant monetary value, everything even lightly enchanted.~
@1868 = ~My grandmother Anzhela -- my grandfather's third wife and the only one he didn't murder -- she had several chests full of heirloom jewelry... beautiful. A bit on the gaudy side sometimes, but there were several pieces there that would have looked magnificent on you.~
@1869 = ~I don't doubt they're decorating a white dragon's lair now, but... (sigh)~
@1870 = ~I don't need your family's lost wealth, Adrian. You're more than enough.~
@1871 = ~You went digging through your grandmother's jewelry, did you?~
@1872 = ~I'd have loved to have seen them.~
@1873 = ~There's more than enough jewelry in Amn, you know.~
@1874 = ~I'm glad to hear it, but I'd have liked to have something more substantial to give you. As it is, all I have is *this*.~
@1875 = ~My dear, apparently some of us never do recover from the childhood desire to dig through every treasure chest in sight.~
@1876 = ~Still, it's a pity. I'd have liked to have something more substantial to give you. As it is, all I have is *this*.~
@1877 = ~You would have loved them, <CHARNAME>. I'd have given you a chest full of them if I could, but as it is, all I have left is *this*.~
@1878 = ~Still, I'd have liked to have something more substantial to give you. As it is, all I have is *this*.~
@1879 = ~My grandfather's old signet ring. He gave it to me when I proved myself to him. It's not enchanted in any way, oddly enough... the slavers would have taken it from me if it had been, their own misgivings aside. I can't say grandfather was that creative at designing the thing. Banites.~
@1880 = ~It's not the most beautiful thing in the Realms, and there's no explaining away its resemblence to a certain holy symbol, but maybe that's fitting for a daughter of Bhaal.~
@1881 = ~In any case, it's the only heirloom I still have, so I'd like you to have it.~
@1882 = ~Not beautiful? Your grandmother's jewelry must have been exquisite, because this is gorgeous work, if a bit large.~
@1883 = ~The thing really does just scream "power," doesn't it? I love it, Adrian. Thank you.~
@1884 = ~It could have "Death to Bhaalspawn" engraved on the inside, and I'd still love it if it were from you.~
@1885 = ~I... um, that's very sweet, but I really can't accept something like... this.~
@1886 = ~I can't. As much as I appreciate the gesture, if it's the only thing you have left, I can't take it from you.~
@1887 = ~I'm not asking you to wear it openly. Just to accept it.~
@1888 = ~If it means this much to you... very well. Thank you.~
@1889 = ~I'm sorry, I can't.~
@1890 = ~<CHARNAME>, I *want* you to have it. Please.~
@1891 = ~I... see. Well, perhaps I'll be able to find something more appropriate from the next jewelry merchant we come across.~
@1892 = ~We can put it on a chain around your neck, perhaps. Probably out of sight so that it doesn't get you in any trouble with the unenlightened masses.~
@1893 = ~<CHARNAME>? Ahh... it's your watch, I see. Better you than one of the others. If you'd like to get some rest, I'll take over.~
@1894 = ~What's wrong? You look terrible!~
@1895 = ~And have you pass out when your own watch comes up? Get some sleep.~
@1896 = ~That sounds good. Thank you.~
@1897 = ~That's not happening, I don't think. Any rest to<DAYNIGHT> is a lost cause.~
@1898 = ~Thank you for the vote of confidence. No, I'm fine.~
@1899 = ~Good night.~
@1900 = ~Just... nightmares. Nothing like yours, but I guess they were kind of inevitable. Don't... tell the others. Please.~
@1901 = ~You're having nightmares also? Do you want to talk about it?~
@1902 = ~I wasn't planning to do so. You should know by now that what you say to me stays with me.~
@1903 = ~They're not your enemies, Adrian.~
@1904 = ~Inevitable? How so?~
@1905 = ~I have enough to worry about with my own nightmares. I can't deal with yours also.~
@1906 = ~Not particularly. I... those were the longest months of my life, <CHARNAME>. The ones before I met you. I've never been... I don't think, I--~
@1907 = ~No, I do know that. But... those were the longest months of my life, <CHARNAME>. The ones before I met you. I've never been... I don't think, I--~
@1908 = ~No? Perhaps not at the moment, but I've no desire to flaunt my weaknesses for them.~
@1909 = ~I... those were the longest months of my life, <CHARNAME>. The ones before I met you. I've never been... I don't think, I--~
@1910 = ~Nine Hells. Listen to this. I'm not even coherent to<DAYNIGHT>. I... can't say I've never spent time in enemy hands before, but... not like that.~
@1911 = ~No, decent people tend not to torture their prisoners. You've been imprisoned before?~
@1912 = ~Don't upset yourself over a nightmare. Whatever happened, it's over now.~
@1913 = ~Given the ghoulish company you used to keep, I'm surprised it bothers you so much.~
@1914 = ~You've seen me dealing with nightmares for how long now? Why didn't you ever mention anything!?~
@1915 = ~Once, in Suzail. Cormyr. War had broken out when I was traveling abroad with my uncle, and... needless to say, things didn't go very well for us. But compared to the last few months...~
@1916 = ~I know it is. I'm fine, <CHARNAME>. Really, I am. I just...~
@1917 = ~Of course. I suppose that makes everything acceptable.~
@1918 = ~I... suppose it never occurred to me to do so. I'm okay, <CHARNAME>. I really am. I just...~
@1919 = ~It's funny, you know. People draw the lines so starkly... black and white. Three months trapped in a cage in a slaving caravan. It got easier later, but at the beginning, when people still knew where I was from...~
@1920 = ~It wasn't the slavers who scared me. They didn't give a damn about me so long as I didn't cause problems, but the other prisoners... they weren't quite so apathetic.~
@1921 = ~Zhent. Zhentarim skymage, no less, and it isn't as if I hadn't roasted my own fair share of caravans. With the dead pegasus right there... well, they were angry. So very angry.~
@1922 = ~People are just people, and when pushed to their limits, sometimes they snap.~
@1923 = ~Pull yourself together. My dreams are far worse than this and I don't fall apart over them.~
@1924 = ~Pegasus? Wouldn't a pegasus hate someone like you?~
@1925 = ~The idiots probably didn't even recognize that they were acting just like their enemies.~
@1926 = ~Considering what your old friends are like, you can't really blame them for that.~
@1927 = ~Maybe. I still find myself praying that they met even worse fates than I did, but... I suppose that's a fair way to look at it.~
@1928 = ~I'm glad to hear I'm such a burden for you. But if you'd rather stand watch in silence, I'd be happy to oblige.~
@1929 = ~Displays of power, <CHARNAME>. Some of us got a thrill from enslaving monsters. Me... I enjoyed the irony. I treated her fairly well, for what it's worth.~
@1930 = ~Maybe. In the end, perhaps the only thing that separates us is self-knowledge. I don't know.~
@1931 = ~Lovely, <CHARNAME>, how some people are allowed to torture and others aren't. No doubt you think I deserved it.~
@1932 = ~I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.~
@1933 = ~It doesn't really matter if you deserved it or not. It happened.~
@1934 = ~You lost the right to complain about it a long time ago.~
@1935 = ~I guess this isn't the best time for attempted levity.~
@1936 = ~Then you're one of the few people who wouldn't have.~
@1937 = ~How very concise.~
@1938 = ~It's a wonder you can bear to look at me at all.~
@1939 = ~But I think we've wasted enough time talking. I'd hate to find out that something sneaked up upon us while I was sitting here whining at you.~
@1940 = ~Still, I'd rather not try to sleep again until you can join me.~
@1941 = ~You're welcome to stand watch with me for the moment.~
@1942 = ~Once I join you, I won't be letting you sleep again for quite some time.~
@1943 = ~In that case, perhaps I should get <PLAYER2> to stand watch right now.~
@1944 = ~In that case, perhaps I should get <PLAYER3> to stand watch right now.~
@1945 = ~I'm afraid that won't be happening to<DAYNIGHT>.~
@1946 = ~Still, once your watch is over... this isn't exactly how I'd expected to broach the topic, but perhaps I was a fool for not doing so earlier.~
@1947 = ~Would you spend the night with me?~
@1948 = ~I'd like that.~
@1949 = ~You're really not very attractive like this.~
@1950 = ~Not now. I don't want to serve merely as a distraction.~
@1951 = ~Yes. It certainly took you long enough!~
@1952 = ~Mmm, I do like the sound of that.~
@1953 = ~I doubt that will go over all too well, but... by all means, my dear.~
@1954 = ~No? Then... I'd hate to disgust you further. I'll see you tomorrow.~
@1955 = ~(smile) And I'd almost rather we forget about to<DAYNIGHT>'s watch and enjoy this now.~
@1956 = ~No, I don't suppose I am. I suppose I'll simply see you tomorrow, then.~
@1957 = ~I can assure you, you wouldn't, but if you'd rather wait... fine.~
@1958 = ~The next fifteen or so minutes are going to feel longer still... I'd almost rather we forget about to<DAYNIGHT>'s watch and enjoy this now.~
@1959 = ~They call Athkatla the City of Coin... and we've certainly managed to accumulate a fair share of that coin ourselves.~
@1960 = ~It's a pity we haven't had a chance to put some of it to more personal use.~
@1961 = ~What did you have in mind?~
@1962 = ~And here I thought we were doing nothing but putting it to personal use.~
@1963 = ~I should think it obvious that we need every piece of gold we can find.~
@1964 = ~Should I be expecting a night of dark decadence someday soon?~
@1965 = ~We need to focus on the task at hand, Adrian.~
@1966 = ~They call Athkatla the City of Coin... and we certainly managed to accumulate a fair share of that coin ourselves.~
@1967 = ~It's a pity we didn't have the chance to put some of it to more personal use.~
@1968 = ~I should think it obvious that we needed every piece of gold we could find.~
@1969 = ~Well, I'm not quite sure where to find the priestesses of Loviatar here, and in my... rather comprehensive experience, no festivity is quite complete without them--~
@1970 = ~Don't look at me like that, <CHARNAME>. You know full well that they'd pale in comparison to you... as much as they might like to believe otherwise.~
@1971 = ~Don't look at me like that, <CHARNAME>. I didn't think you'd care for that brand of... entertainment, but you should know better than to ask.~
@1972 = ~In Ust Natha? I should certainly hope so. Pity the worship of Loviatar hasn't spread quite so far. In my... rather comprehensive experience, no festivity is quite complete without her worshippers--~
@1973 = ~Perhaps I should have said "frivolous" instead of "personal," then.~
@1974 = ~But we've found so very, very much of it that a bit spent extravagantly would hardly be noticed at all.~
@1975 = ~As you wish.~
@1976 = ~Regardless, the whole train of thought is moot. Given the state of affairs, we don't have nearly enough time to wallow in mindless decadence, but if we did...~
@1977 = ~How would you like to spend it?~
@1978 = ~I'd prefer to spend more time in the country myself, maybe get to watch a sunrise without worrying about the next day.~
@1979 = ~I think I'd enjoy some of your suggestions.~
@1980 = ~Frankly, I wouldn't mind simply spending it in bed.~
@1981 = ~Strange as it may sound to you, I prefer to keep myself busy with matters of importance.~
@1982 = ~As long as you're nearby, I couldn't care less.~
@1983 = ~Traveling, albeit without the constant attempts on my life.~
@1984 = ~The sun dawns over the city as well, my dear.~
@1985 = ~(smile) I'm sure we can get a bit more creative than that, my dear.~
@1986 = ~Have you never heard of mixing business and pleasure, my dear? True, I would probably advise against it, but it does have its advantages.~
@1987 = ~(smile) As nice as that is to hear, I'm sure we can get a bit more creative.~
@1988 = ~(smile) New places and new sights, is it?~
@1989 = ~You know, back when I still lived in Sembia, I might have taken a lover to watch the sun rise over the Sea of Fallen Stars once or twice. A bit quixotic, perhaps, but it... ah, tended to get results.~
@1990 = ~When we get the chance, perhaps we should climb down to the docks to watch it set over the ocean. That's a sight I've never really seen.~
@1991 = ~If we ever get back to Athkatla, perhaps we should climb down to the docks to watch it set over the ocean. That's a sight I've never really seen.~
@1992 = ~"A bit quixotic?" Darling, you're drowning in romanticism right now.~
@1993 = ~Given the disposition of the docks, it may well be the last sight we ever see.~
@1994 = ~I used to watch the sun set over the ocean in Candlekeep. Those days are long gone, but a night's reminiscence would be welcome.~
@1995 = ~Eventually, perhaps, but for now we need to stay focused.~
@1996 = ~It isn't that, <CHARNAME>... well, not exactly.~
@1997 = ~I really don't mean to, <CHARNAME>.~
@1998 = ~Any thief foolish enough to touch you would be lucky to just lose the hand.~
@1999 = ~You're right, I know.~
@2000 = ~This is a strange time to get wistful, I know, but I suppose... well, I've always thought that love was for fools and madmen. And I've certainly been both in the past, but--~
@2001 = ~Hells. Since I've become incoherent, perhaps I should just ask you what love means to you.~
@2002 = ~It means getting to know somebody more completely than you know yourself, and perhaps getting to know yourself a bit better in the process.~
@2003 = ~It's the small things that matter. A shared look, a shared touch, the ring of laughter, a night curled up by a fire.~
@2004 = ~It's best left unspoken. Analyze it too much and it'll just turn to mist in the end.~
@2005 = ~It means giving of yourself entirely, unsurpassed trust in another person. It may be terrifying, but it's worth it all the same.~
@2006 = ~Love? Apparently it means sentimental digressions and frivolous questions.~
@2007 = ~I think I'd be as incoherent about it as you seem to be.~
@2008 = ~No greater gift than self-knowledge, is it? I would never have valued that before, but... I don't know.~
@2009 = ~The little things that you remember once everything else has faded? As much as I don't care for the transience of that... I don't know.~
@2010 = ~Perhaps that's why so many of the great sages end their lives alone. Too much time spent thinking and not enough spent living... I don't know.~
@2011 = ~It's terrifying even when you don't stop to think about it, but... I don't know.~
@2012 = ~Ha! Excuse the frivolity, then.~
@2013 = ~Well, I certainly can't hold that against you.~
@2014 = ~I should thank you. For your persistance. I could laugh at myself for being so nervous at first, for almost throwing this away before it even began. I would have regretted that, I think.~
@2015 = ~You should thank me for my patience also.~
@2016 = ~Taking the chance was brave of you. More so than I think you realize.~
@2017 = ~As if I was going to let you get away.~
@2018 = ~Don't worry. You'll get a chance to thank me with interest soon enough.~
@2019 = ~I have to say that I'm actually getting tired of this. I liked you better when you were a closed book.~
@2020 = ~Mercy, my lady! I certainly won't deny that.~
@2021 = ~I've... never actually considered that before. It still seems a bit ridiculous, but... less so than I would have expected.~
@2022 = ~Heh. No, I suppose you didn't give me much of a chance to run.~
@2023 = ~Mmm. That sounds... rather interesting.~
@2024 = ~Oh. I... see. You really do know how to destroy a nice moment, don't you?~
@2025 = ~Ah, listen to me. So much to be done, and here I am indulging in shameless sentimentality. This is becoming something of a habit.~
@2026 = ~It isn't shameless. You don't need to pretend you're a heartless bastard, you know.~
@2027 = ~We should indulge more often. I think I'd like that.~
@2028 = ~It must be all of that elven blood you hate so much.~
@2029 = ~I don't mind these romantic digressions at all.~
@2030 = ~A habit I would very much like to break you of.~
@2031 = ~Heartless? I hardly pretend that at all. Still, it is more than a bit indulgent.~
@2032 = ~Mmm, and here I thought we did. Quite often.~
@2033 = ~Mmm, I think I would as well.~
@2034 = ~At least that gives me something to blame it on.~
@2035 = ~No? At least I'm not boring you.~
@2036 = ~In that case, the songs and poetry can wait for another day. And I can only pray -- to any god who'll listen -- that there be many, many more of those.~
@2037 = ~But come, <CHARNAME>. The songs and poetry... that can wait for another day. And I can only pray -- to any god who'll listen -- that there be many, many more of those.~
@2038 = ~Would that Irenicus fell as easily as those slavers back in the Coronet... and the same for my initial captors as well.~
@2039 = ~No matter. I'll take whatever vengeance I can get.~
@2040 = ~Your initial captors?~
@2041 = ~Well, going north and hunting down Melvauntians would be a bit out of our ways.~
@2042 = ~We saved people. Is revenge really all you care about?~
@2043 = ~Don't worry. We'll get even with Irenicus too.~
@2044 = ~As long as I don't have to listen to any more of Hendak's awkward begging, I'm happy.~
@2045 = ~That's nice, I suppose. We don't really have time to talk about this.~
@2046 = ~Unpleasant people. Granted, everyone back home is fairly unpleasant.~
@2047 = ~Indeed. It's not really a priority anyway. I'd rather not end up needing another rescue myself, and if I head home... that's rather likely. Still...~
@2048 = ~It should be obvious by now that I care about magic and money also, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. But... I don't know. You might be right.~
@2049 = ~I don't doubt it for a moment.~
@2050 = ~That was rather embarrassing, wasn't it? A proud northerner reduced to... gods, I suppose I know a bit about that myself these days.~
@2051 = ~No? Too busy listening to the rustle of the wind? Fine, I'll leave you alone.~
@2052 = ~I've never actually... hunted slavers before. A useless task if ever there was one, but... heh, once you've been on the other side, I suppose.~
@2053 = ~Forget it. Let's just move on.~
@2054 = ~Hells, if not for all the loot we dragged out of that sphere, I'd have almost wished we had never gone after that damned necromancer at all.~
@2055 = ~He was a danger to the Realms that needed to be stopped.~
@2056 = ~And abandon Valygar to his fate?~
@2057 = ~Well, he's dead now, so there's no use worrying about him at all.~
@2058 = ~He got what was coming to him.~
@2059 = ~Hey, it's not every day you get to slay an ancient necromancer.~
@2060 = ~Yes, yes. I'm sure there are plenty of dangers to the Realms that need to be stopped. As far as I'm concerned, let the paladins take care of that.~
@2061 = ~Why not? I'm quite sure he's looking forward to abandoning me to mine.~
@2062 = ~I'm not *worried* about him, per se.~
@2063 = ~I... suppose so.~
@2064 = ~If you start going after demilichs next, excuse me if I watch from the side.~
@2065 = ~Don't get me wrong, I enjoy puzzling things out, but the sort of questions I find myself asking in the wake of Lavok's demise... I don't particularly care for them.~
@2066 = ~Then ignore them. You're thinking too much.~
@2067 = ~What types of questions?~
@2068 = ~Another round of "was he good or was he evil," is it?~
@2069 = ~I suppose you don't need to be an ancient necromancer to realize your life is a mess.~
@2070 = ~I don't care for philosophy, so forgive me if I don't want to hear it.~
@2071 = ~Maybe.~
@2072 = ~What? No, nothing so ridiculous.~
@2073 = ~You really are delightful, aren't you?~
@2074 = ~Very well. Some <DAYNIGHT>s, <CHARNAME>, you are exquisitely poor company.~
@2075 = ~I can't help but consider his fall. He had all of the power and wealth his magic could grant him, and he reached out just a bit further...~
@2076 = ~Was he broken by the end? I couldn't say. He fought that entity to the last, protecting this plane from its ravages. That takes strength. Enormous strength, but his regret?~
@2077 = ~I can't decide if that was authentic or the result of years of self-pity.~
@2078 = ~It was self-pity and nothing more. There's no real chance for remorse in one who has blackened his soul to that extent.~
@2079 = ~Does it really matter in the end? There was a spark of goodness in him buried deeply, even if a taste of suffering was required for it to finally flourish.~
@2080 = ~Strength? Maybe, but it was weakness that shone through in the end. Whatever core of fortitude was once there had long since been eaten away.~
@2081 = ~I think only Lavok could answer those concerns, and he's not quite available for questioning.~
@2082 = ~It hardly makes a difference in the end. He's still dead.~
@2083 = ~I suppose I should have expected that from a paladin. Come down from your pedestal, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, and you might find that not everything is as black and white as that.~
@2084 = ~Spoken like a paladin, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, but live a little and you might find that not everything is as black and white as that.~
@2085 = ~Hmm. Is it strange that I can't decide whether the church of Ilmater or Loviatar would agree more with that assessment? Perhaps they're closer than either would care to admit.~
@2086 = ~I don't think so, <CHARNAME>. Had we forgone the quest, I dare say he would have continued to fight that entity for another century, if need be.~
@2087 = ~I think Lavok is the last person who could answer them.~
@2088 = ~True enough. Still...~
@2089 = ~We build our houses of cards, and when they come crumbling down... I don't know.~
@2090 = ~Not so frightening now, you overgrown pink lizard.~
@2091 = ~I think this calls for some wine and red dragon meat, assuming it didn't set the former afire. I haven't eaten dragon in months.~
@2092 = ~Well, we won't need to worry about finding fire to cook it. Half the cavern is ablaze.~
@2093 = ~That's vile. You don't eat your talking, thinking enemies.~
@2094 = ~Is dragon even edible?~
@2095 = ~Nice of you to be brave now. You looked about ready to run and hide before.~
@2096 = ~Would you stop circling the damn dragon and start removing those scales?~
@2097 = ~You may want to put some of those out, <CHARNAME>. Come. Hopefully old Firkraag won't be too disappointing.~
@2098 = ~You should tell that to the dragons, I think. But have it your way, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@2099 = ~White dragon certainly is, and tastes well enough when there's nothing else available. Hopefully old Firkraag won't be too disappointing.~
@2100 = ~Unlike you, <CHARNAME>, I happen to be sane.~
@2101 = ~Well, I suppose that would be the logical first step.~
@2102 = ~And here we are, exactly where we were always meant to be: working for the true power in Amn. I would warn you to be careful, but I'm sure you've figured that out for yourself by now.~
@2103 = ~Don't sound so happy about it. They're just using us.~
@2104 = ~Yes, the alternative wasn't particularly savory, was it?~
@2105 = ~I know how to handle thieves.~
@2106 = ~They seemed pretty trustworthy.~
@2107 = ~I intend to get the best out of the deal that I can, and I can't imagine Bodhi would have let me in on her regime without biting me first.~
@2108 = ~Everyone in the world is out to use you, <CHARNAME>. All you can do is get as much in return as possible.~
@2109 = ~Unless you enjoy the thought of destabilizing Athkatla entirely. I suppose the idea has its merits, but I'd hate this country even more with vampires in charge of it.~
@2110 = ~I know you do, <CHARNAME>. Still, you would not be the first <PRO_MANWOMAN> destroyed by overconfidence.~
@2111 = ~I suppose we'll find out quickly enough if you don't. Watch your back and it should be fine. Certainly better than the alternative.~
@2112 = ~They're Shadow Thieves, <CHARNAME>. They're only trustworthy so long as you have something to offer them. I suggest we make ourselves useful.~
@2113 = ~Indeed. At least the Shadow Thieves' motivations are comprehensible. Vampires... I wouldn't even know where to begin.~
@2114 = ~I hope you know what you're doing, <CHARNAME>, throwing in with this blood-sucking fiend.~
@2115 = ~At least she's playing me straight. More than the Shadow Thieves ever did.~
@2116 = ~I like to side with the winner. Given the situation, I'm guessing that will be Bodhi.~
@2117 = ~There was something... odd about her. I'm not sure I was thinking straight when I said yes, but it's too late to turn back now.~
@2118 = ~Straight? <CHARNAME>, that creature was as crooked as anything I've ever seen, and twice as subtle as any Shadow Thief. Don't fool yourself into thinking it's your friend.~
@2119 = ~I like the side with the winner who isn't going to tear my throat out on a whim once it's finished with its game. The undead play by different rules, <CHARNAME>. Don't forget that.~
@2120 = ~Wonderful. Probably some sort of subtle vampire mind control. Just... be careful and hopefully we'll get through this alive.~
@2121 = ~Well, here we are, I suppose.~
@2122 = ~Here we are indeed.~
@2123 = ~You don't sound too happy about it.~
@2124 = ~Why so unhappy? It's a town of lawless thugs. Isn't this your sort of thing?~
@2125 = ~Imoen won't rescue herself. Let's go.~
@2126 = ~A prison meant to hold people like us. Spellcasters. This is going to be fun, isn't it?~
@2127 = ~It makes me nervous too, but we'll get through it. We always have.~
@2128 = ~It's no worse than walking into a dragon's lair, is it?~
@2129 = ~Come on, where's your sense of adventure?~
@2130 = ~Don't lose your nerve now, Adrian.~
@2131 = ~A prison meant to hold people like me... this is going to be fun, isn't it?~
@2132 = ~I'll be fine. It's just...the thought of walking into a prison meant to hold people like us. Spellcasters. It makes me... nervous.~
@2133 = ~More nervous than walking into a dragon's lair?~
@2134 = ~I'll be fine. It's just...the thought of walking into a prison meant to hold people like me. It makes me... nervous.~
@2135 = ~You'd be surprised. In any case, it's that... fortress on the horizon that's bothering me. The thought of walking into a prison meant to hold people like us. Spellcasters. It makes me... nervous.~
@2136 = ~You'd be surprised. In any case, it's that... fortress on the horizon that's bothering me. The thought of walking into a prison meant to hold people like me. It makes me... nervous.~
@2137 = ~True enough, I suppose.~
@2138 = ~Well, you haven't led me wrong so far.~
@2139 = ~I just don't like prisons, <CHARNAME>.~
@2140 = ~With your sanity, apparently.~
@2141 = ~I'll be fine.~
@2142 = ~Mmm, a bottle of wine will take the nerves away, no doubt. I'm sure I've got at least one squirreled away. Not like I can't find more in a city full of pirates.~
@2143 = ~I'd rather you nervous than witless, Adrian.~
@2144 = ~I think I'd like some of that too.~
@2145 = ~You may want to save that for later. We might need it.~
@2146 = ~Oh, put that bottle down for now and just come over here for a bit.~
@2147 = ~I'd be more than happy to... distract you for a time. In an inn, perhaps.~
@2148 = ~(leave him to it)~
@2149 = ~<CHARNAME>, you know full well that that's completely unfair. But you're right. We're so close now, we might as well get this over with.~
@2150 = ~Mmm, I certainly expected as much.~
@2151 = ~If you're trying to make me even more nervous, <CHARNAME>, I think you just succeeded.~
@2152 = ~With an invitation like that... ahh, very well.~
@2153 = ~Mmm, unless you'd like to make love like a pirate, pressed against the wall in a back alley, I suppose that's a very good idea.~
@2154 = ~It would end like this, wouldn't it? The story of my godsdamned life.~
@2155 = ~Don't write my eulogy yet, Adrian. I don't plan on dying here.~
@2156 = ~I'm sorry. I should never have dragged you into this, not with my own future so uncertain.~
@2157 = ~Don't fall apart on me, Adrian. I need you to be strong now.~
@2158 = ~At least you've still got your wretched soul intact. Pity I can't say the same for your heart.~
@2159 = ~I... I know. I just...~
@2160 = ~I... maybe. I don't know. I just...~
@2161 = ~I... I'm sorry. I just...~
@2162 = ~Hells, <CHARNAME>. I'm getting tired of tragedy. All things considered, perhaps I should have expected something suitably horrific.~
@2163 = ~I hope you're not saying what I think you're saying.~
@2164 = ~I really can't deal with this from you right now.~
@2165 = ~And you think I'm not tired of this?~
@2166 = ~You've finally figured out that you reap what you sow, have you?~
@2167 = ~No. No... I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. This isn't fair of me.~
@2168 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. This isn't fair of me.~
@2169 = ~And I've sown my fair share of misery? That hasn't bothered you before.~
@2170 = ~Wait, I didn't mean that.~
@2171 = ~What a pair we are to<DAYNIGHT>. I'm sorry... this isn't fair of me.~
@2172 = ~I just feel useless. I wish I knew something... anything about this, but I don't. My own area of expertise, and I'm lost.~
@2173 = ~When we get out of here, we can look into it... pull down the walls of Candlekeep and tear the library apart if we have to.~
@2174 = ~Don't look at me like that. This is bad enough as it without worrying if you're about to do something insane.~
@2175 = ~Forget about Candlekeep. It's Irenicus I'm going to tear apart. And his pet vampire.~
@2176 = ~After everything that's happened to me because of their incompetence, I think I'd *like* to tear down the walls of Candlekeep.~
@2177 = ~So your knowledge of dark magic is less than complete... I guess that's something decent to take away from this conversation.~
@2178 = ~I'll do whatever I damn well have to if it fixes this. I just... I don't know what to do.~
@2179 = ~I can imagine. If there were anything I could do...~
@2180 = ~Right. Right... if we can keep from walking directly into another trap. I feel like such a fool.~
@2181 = ~Then we will. If it makes you feel any better, we can tear apart the whole damn world.~
@2182 = ~Knowledge is power, dark or otherwise. You don't have to look at me and see Irenicus. I--~
@2183 = ~Here. Take my arm. It's not much, but if it helps at all...~
@2184 = ~Thank you. That might help, at least a bit.~
@2185 = ~Please. Just stay near.~
@2186 = ~Not right now. We need to get out of this deathtrap.~
@2187 = ~Just leave me alone right now.~
@2188 = ~I don't intend to go anywhere, <CHARNAME>.~
@2189 = ~Right. Of course.~
@2190 = ~Hmm. A trace of elven blood goes a long way in a place like this, I suppose. I've never been so grateful for the infravision.~
@2191 = ~I'd be lost without it myself.~
@2192 = ~And I've never wished for it more.~
@2193 = ~I do hope you're enjoying the sights.~
@2194 = ~We're in the Underdark. You don't need to sound so calm about it.~
@2195 = ~This isn't the time or place for conversation, sorcerer.~
@2196 = ~It was always just a minor convenience in the past, and now... now it's the difference between life and death. Funny, that. Simply being here...~
@2197 = ~Find me a scroll and I'll cast it for you. Simply being here...~
@2198 = ~Find a scroll and cast it, then. Simply being here...~
@2199 = ~I won't deny it. Hmm, simply being here...~
@2200 = ~Calm? No, this is one of the most dangerous places in Faerun. I won't deny that, but simply being here...~
@2201 = ~I'm not quite sure what to make of it. They're quite beautiful in their own way, though... these caverns. If you lit one up entirely, I can't help but wonder what you'd find.~
@2202 = ~Don't you dare try it. I don't want to get attacked by everything in the vicinity.~
@2203 = ~An entirely different world, under our feet... it is a bit humbling to actually see it, isn't it?~
@2204 = ~I'm sure you'd just see several dozen mind flayers staring at you. A beautiful sight indeed.~
@2205 = ~You really do turn quixotic at the weirdest of things, don't you?~
@2206 = ~Would you like to try?~
@2207 = ~Ha! We would be too. I don't deny that.~
@2208 = ~Humbling? I don't know. There are peasants wasting their short lives on the same patch of earth for decades, and here we are, wandering the most secretive and dangerous place in Faerun.~
@2209 = ~Ha! Hells, <CHARNAME>, I'm going to have nightmares tonight. Well, more than I usually do.~
@2210 = ~If you would rather I panicked, I can try to oblige you.~
@2211 = ~Hells, <CHARNAME>, of course not! I'd like to get out of this alive.~
@2212 = ~It's strange, though, actually being here. It's a fate I've considered more than once... barely avoided, truth be told. Back home, I--~
@2213 = ~You what?~
@2214 = ~Did terrible, terrible things. Yes, I know.~
@2215 = ~Are you alright? You look a bit ill.~
@2216 = ~Oh, this isn't going to be pretty, is it? I don't want one of your nasty stories right now. Things are bad enough as it is.~
@2217 = ~I'll... be fine, <CHARNAME>.~
@2218 = ~We used to trade with dark elves. Perhaps we still do. Possibly even with those of that nearby city, I wouldn't know. Delightful merchants if ever there were, but better to trade with them than to be traded to them. My masters made it clear that those were my alternatives.~
@2219 = ~Funny, how things turn out. Here we are anyway. Granted, at least we still have our freedom.~
@2220 = ~That's not funny at all. That's terrible.~
@2221 = ~Well, why don't we focus on fates not avoided instead. Like me and my missing soul.~
@2222 = ~You've spent your whole life in way over your head, haven't you?~
@2223 = ~I need you focused, Adrian, not dwelling on past nightmares.~
@2224 = ~Is it? Hmm. I guess I don't notice anymore.~
@2225 = ~I... know. I know, <CHARNAME>. We'll get through this. Just hold on a while longer.~
@2226 = ~That's a sobering thought, isn't it? I really can't deny it, though. Not now.~
@2227 = ~Of course. I'll leave you alone, then.~
@2228 = ~And people wonder why I hate elves so much.~
@2229 = ~He was more than a bit arrogant.~
@2230 = ~Not all elves are like Elhan. Don't hate all of us.~
@2231 = ~Not every elf is like Elhan. You don't need to hate all of them.~
@2232 = ~All things considered, could you really blame them for being so terse and suspicious?~
@2233 = ~I don't blame you. And now we have to run errands for the fool.~
@2234 = ~Couldn't you have at least tried to control yourself?~
@2235 = ~'Arrogant' is the most pleasant thing I could call him.~
@2236 = ~No? I suppose some are even more infuriating. But we'd best get this over with.~
@2237 = ~I take issue with more than just that, but... well, we haven't the time to list their faults right now.~
@2238 = ~Well, we'd best get this over with.~
@2239 = ~I assure you, <CHARNAME>, I was trying.~
@2240 = ~He's mad, isn't he? Completely mad.~
@2241 = ~You just noticed that, did you?~
@2242 = ~If madness is a prerequisite for wanting to be a god, it's no wonder the world is so insane.~
@2243 = ~Utterly. Through the roof. You're a paragon of sanity in comparison.~
@2244 = ~I can certainly sympathize with his need for vengeance and dreams of godhood. That doesn't mean I intend to spare him, of course.~
@2245 = ~Ah... no. Not quite. But I'm not sure I really understood what it meant before.~
@2246 = ~Perhaps that's true.~
@2247 = ~You're too kind. Still.~
@2248 = ~Quite the opposite, I should think.~
@2249 = ~Look at him... swallowed up by vengeance, and what is he now? A caricature of himself. There's nothing elven there. There's nothing even human there anymore. There's just...~
@2250 = ~Madness. Hatred. Ambition.~
@2251 = ~You're awfully thoughtful about this. I'd have expected a bit more anger from you.~
@2252 = ~Don't get worked up over it. He'll be dead shortly.~
@2253 = ~Call it what you will. He's still one of the most powerful wizards in Faerun.~
@2254 = ~I... I don't know, <CHARNAME>. It's a bit late for that.~
@2255 = ~In many ways, I think he already is.~
@2256 = ~And what does it matter in the end?~
@2257 = ~I could blame the elves for making him what he is, but... I suppose I've spent my whole life doing that. For once I'd like to put the blame where it belongs.~
@2258 = ~Maybe... maybe for more than just once. Let's just finish this.~
@2259 = ~You would be wise to stay away from Vasiliev, <CHARNAME>. I do not care for the way he looks at you.~
@2260 = ~Jaheira, that's my business, not yours.~
@2261 = ~Why? Because of an organization he no longer works for?~
@2262 = ~But he's finally beginning to calm down around me.~
@2263 = ~Why? What do you think about this?~
@2264 = ~There's nothing going on between us, Jaheira. Nor do I want there to be.~
@2265 = ~I do not contest that, <CHARNAME>, but I know more about this man than you do. I do not deny that the stories told about him by Harpers may be exaggerated, but his heart has caused him nothing but trouble in the past.~
@2266 = ~His loyalties may have changed, but he is still who he was, <CHARNAME>. I do not deny that the stories told about him by Harpers may be exaggerated, but his heart has caused him nothing but trouble in the past.~
@2267 = ~Perhaps, but he is still who he was. I do not deny that the stories told about him by Harpers may be exaggerated, but his heart has caused him nothing but trouble in the past.~
@2268 = ~Nothing good will come of it, <CHARNAME>. I do not deny that the stories told about him by Harpers may be exaggerated, but his heart has caused him nothing but trouble in the past.~
@2269 = ~I am glad to hear it. See to it that he understands this as well.~
@2270 = ~You have enough to concern you without worrying about the demons that may plague a renegade Zhent. Do not forget that.~
@2271 = ~My lady, might I speak with you for a moment?~
@2272 = ~Of course. What is it, Anomen?~
@2273 = ~I'm sorry if I've led you on, but...~
@2274 = ~Whatever it is, I don't want to hear it.~
@2275 = ~I would speak of Adrian, my lady. I have seen the way that you and he look at each other, and I fear for you. He is an evil man, <CHARNAME>, one who has attempted to hide the magnitude of his depravity from us, but the truth won out in the end, as is only right.~
@2276 = ~He... my lady, has he charmed you? I know little of the ways of magicians, but there is nothing that I would consider beyond that man.~
@2277 = ~You only see what he chooses to show you, Anomen, but there is more to him than that. He has neither charmed, seduced, nor corrupted me, I assure you.~
@2278 = ~Do you think so little of me that you believe I would be charmed, Anomen? He has more to offer me than you realize.~
@2279 = ~Maybe. It was a strange, convoluted seduction, true, but a seduction none the less. Whatever it was, it's over.~
@2280 = ~You can take your assumptions and choke on them, Anomen.~
@2281 = ~I am glad to hear it. You are... nobler than I, my lady, to see goodness even in one such as he. I... I shall not bother you again, <CHARNAME>.~
@2282 = ~I will not claim to understand it, but if this is what you wish, then I... I shall not bother you again, my lady.~
@2283 = ~I am glad that you have come to your senses, <CHARNAME>. Come, let us move on.~
@2284 = ~I see. Then I... I must assume that the Zhentarim snake has corrupted you. I am sorry, my lady, but I cannot bear to see you like this.~
@2285 = ~Careful, <CHARNAME>. That white knight of yours will no doubt be professing his undying love for you any day now.~
@2286 = ~(sigh) Do you think so? Oh, I hope so.~
@2287 = ~He is beginning to take things a bit seriously, isn't he?~
@2288 = ~Leave him alone, Adrian. He's twice the man you'll ever be.~
@2289 = ~Ha! And I look forward to throwing it back in his pompous face.~
@2290 = ~Hells, please tell me you're joking.~
@2291 = ~He has the makings of a great man, whether you're willing to see it or not.~
@2292 = ~I'm not. He's twice the man you'll ever be.~
@2293 = ~Of course I am. I'm not interested in him.~
@2294 = ~Ha! I'm no blushing maiden waiting for her white knight, my dear.~
@2295 = ~I take it you don't want to be his lady wife, then?~
@2296 = ~We'll see. He's certainly twice the man you'll ever be.~
@2297 = ~Perhaps I do. He has the makings of a great man, whether you're willing to see it or not.~
@2298 = ~No. I like him well enough, but I'm not interested in him.~
@2299 = ~And three times the fool, as I'm sure you'll find out soon enough.~
@2300 = ~Heh. As entertaining as that would be, it's probably not worth the inevitable drama.~
@2301 = ~Well, I suppose he's pointed that out enough times for it to become something like the truth. I'm sure you two will be... very happy.~
@2302 = ~Heh. I didn't think you were.~
@2303 = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't know what that scarlet robed freak has been whispering in your ear, but even by a Red Wizard's standards, he... or she, rather, is frankly worthless.~
@2304 = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't know what that scarlet robed freak has been whispering in your ear, but even by a Red Wizard's standards, he's... well, frankly worthless.~
@2305 = ~If you really want one of them, I could point you towards any number who are more stable, but you could honestly do better.~
@2306 = ~Edwin isn't a scarlet robed freak, Adrian. If you treated him with a bit of respect, you would know that.~
@2307 = ~You're seeing things that don't exist. I only wanted to get to know him a bit better.~
@2308 = ~Edwin? You thought... oh. Eww. No, never.~
@2309 = ~If I wanted stable, I would stay away from evil wizards in general. And that's what I plan on doing. Now, could you stop always dragging your organizational feud into this party?~
@2310 = ~In any case, I would have hoped that you had enough notoriety right here.~
@2311 = ~He's not a scarlet robed freak, Adrian. If you treated him with a bit of respect, you would know that.~
@2312 = ~Jealous, are we? You're seeing things that don't exist. I only wanted to get to know him a bit better.~
@2313 = ~More than enough notoriety, to be honest. I'm sick and tired of both of you. Now, could you stop always dragging your organizational feud into this party?~
@2314 = ~I've treated him with as much respect as he deserves. Fine. Enjoy what passes for Thayvian sophistication these days, if you wish.~
@2315 = ~I can't imagine why. Just make sure he doesn't toss a fireball at you in a fit of rage when he finds out that you're not interested.~
@2316 = ~I'm glad to hear it. Just make sure he doesn't toss a fireball at you in a fit of rage when he finds out that you're not interested.~
@2317 = ~Our... organizational feud? If that's the way you see things, then fine.~
@2318 = ~You almost sound as if you prefer him now.~
@2319 = ~You don't need to sound so jealous. Of course I don't.~
@2320 = ~Actually, I do prefer him.~
@2321 = ~...fine. Enjoy whatever it is that passes for Thayvian sophistication these days.~
@2322 = ~<CHARNAME>, you and that mad tiefling...~
@2323 = ~I don't much mind that you've slept with him in the past, but whatever bizarre relationship there is between you, could you please put an end to it?~
@2324 = ~I don't care for being told who I can and can't speak with, Adrian.~
@2325 = ~If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll tell him to keep his distance.~
@2326 = ~What are you talking about? There's nothing going on between us.~
@2327 = ~Loosen up a bit. Maybe you'd enjoy something a bit less conventional yourself.~
@2328 = ~I hardly mind you talking to him, but I have noticed the way he looks at you. I'd have to be blind to miss it... and a fool to welcome it.~
@2329 = ~Very well. If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll have to dissuade his attentions.~
@2330 = ~There isn't anything going on between us.~
@2331 = ~I suppose this was bound to come up eventually. I do appreciate him. Quite a bit.~
@2332 = ~I don't care for being lied to, <CHARNAME>.~
@2333 = ~Fine. I suppose this was bound to come up eventually. I do appreciate him. Quite a bit, in fact.~
@2334 = ~It's not a lie. Our relationship was merely physical, nothing more substantial.~
@2335 = ~I haven't invited him to my bed in quite some time. There really isn't anything going on anymore.~
@2336 = ~But you're imagining things!~
@2337 = ~I very much doubt that.~
@2338 = ~Oh, very well. If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll tell him to keep his distance.~
@2339 = ~You'll never know if you don't try.~
@2340 = ~If that's the way you intend to be, I suppose this was bound to come up eventually. I do appreciate him. Quite a bit, in fact.~
@2341 = ~I... see. Very well, then. I certainly won't stand in your way.~
@2342 = ~I see. I'm not quite certain he agrees that there's nothing significant between you... he looks damn interested in worming his way back into your bed.~
@2343 = ~Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, I'll tell him to keep his distance.~
@2344 = ~Does he? That might be interesting.~
@2345 = ~I refuse to discuss this one way or the other.~
@2346 = ~...I'm imagining quite a few things, apparently. But fine. You needn't bother lying in the future.~
@2347 = ~I've tried quite a few things, my dear, but I really don't like to share. Will you break this off or not?~
@2348 = ~Do you? I... suppose that's as much an answer as I could need.~
@2349 = ~I've tried to ignore whatever bizarre relationship there is between you two, but I'm not doing a very good job of it. Could you please put an end to it?~
@2350 = ~Very well. If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll have to tell him to keep his distance.~
@2351 = ~I suppose this was bound to come up eventually. I do appreciate him. Quite a bit, in fact.~
@2352 = ~It's not a lie. I may enjoy speaking with him, but that really is all there is to it.~
@2353 = ~For you, perhaps, but he seems pretty damn interested in worming his way into your bed.~
@2354 = ~I see. If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll tell him to keep his distance.~
@2355 = ~Does he? Well, that might be interesting.~
@2356 = ~Perhaps I should have commented on the situation earlier, but I actually trusted you. Foolish of me, I know.~
@2357 = ~No, don't say anything. I honestly don't want to hear it. If you'd rather that damn tiefling in your bed... well, so be it.~
@2358 = ~(It is no wonder that Adrian's attention is again focused upon you.)~
@2359 = ~(Even in this darkest of places, Adrian's attention is again focused upon you.)~
@2360 = ~(Adrian draws closer to you as you walk, silently wrapping an arm around your waist. He smiles at you, the expression of sincerity saying more than words ever could.)~
@2361 = ~(Adrian seems vaguely annoyed at the world to<DAYNIGHT>, but as his eyes fall upon you, the angry set of his face softens somewhat.)~
@2362 = ~(Humming softly to himself, Adrian reaches out and offers you his hand, the gesture incongruously courtly given his otherwise casual demeanor.)~
@2363 = ~(You find Adrian watching you, openly concerned about your condition. He moves closer to you, wrapping an arm around your shoulders protectively.)~
@2364 = ~(Rifling through your packs, you find a luxurious - if extremely revealing - silken dress. You glance up to find Adrian watching you, a suggestive smile on his face.)~
@2365 = ~(Rifling through your packs, you find a luxurious - if extremely revealing - silken dress. The spider motif makes it obvious where it came from. You glance up to find Adrian watching you, a suggestive smile on his face.)~
@2366 = ~Can we not take at least a <DAYNIGHT> off, <CHARNAME>? A glass of wine and the privacy of dark corner of an inn somewhere seems so much more promising than constant wandering.~
@2367 = ~(Adrian takes your hand in an almost chivalrous gesture. With a slightly ironic smile, he begins to gently massage the tension out of your palm.)~
@2368 = ~(You catch Adrian watching you, his expression for once completely unguarded. Blushing slightly, he looks away.)~
@2369 = ~(Seeing you stumble slightly after a brief moment's dizziness, Adrian wordlessly pulls you close to him, shouldering some of your equipment to make your own pack lighter.)~
@2370 = ~(In an unexpected private moment, Adrian draws near you, his lips brushing against the side of your jaw, one hand tangled in your hair.)~
@2371 = ~(You glance up to find Adrian's attention focused upon you, his expression far from chaste. He somehow manages to give you an innocent smile when he notices that you've seen, and then quickly turns away, laughing softly.)~
@2372 = ~(You feel fingers fall onto your shoulders, gently but firmly massaging the tension out of your neck. Watching Adrian from the corner of your eye, you can tell that he is enjoying the massage as much as you are.)~
@2373 = ~Have I ever thanked you for not letting me throw this away, <CHARNAME>? Because... thank you. Sincerely.~
@2374 = ~(Adrian pulls you into his arms, his hands slipping beneath your clothing. He presses his lips against the back of your neck as he traces arcane symbols across your skin.)~
@2375 = ~You don't need to look at me like that, <CHARNAME>. I know there are more romantic runes out there than 'fireball.' It's simply the first one that comes to mind.~
@2376 = ~I'm not about to enchant you, my dear. Don't worry.~
@2377 = ~(As you look over the group, you find Adrian watching you, a small smile on his lips. As your eyes meet, he quirks an eyebrow in what must be mild amusement before looking away. His smile, however, doesn't fade for a few moments.)~
@2378 = ~(As you look over the group, you find Adrian watching you, a small frown on his lips. As your eyes meet, he gives you an encouraging smile.)~
@2379 = ~(Adrian is humming to himself to<DAYNIGHT>, clearly pleased with the state of affairs. His eyes keep on seeking you out, and there's a faint, slightly suggestive smile upon his face, as if his thoughts are not as innocent as they might be.)~
@2380 = ~On days like this, I almost understand why people worship Lathander. I can't convince you to stop a while and enjoy it, I suppose?~
@2381 = ~On nights like this, I almost understand why people worship Selune. I can't convince you to stop a while and enjoy it, I suppose?~
@2382 = ~I wish my magic were more... appropriate for a romantic situation, but there isn't any point in charming you, no illusion could compare, and I certainly don't want to set you afire.~
@2383 = ~(smile) I suppose I'll have to get more creative. Or perhaps I'll start collecting scrolls.~
@2384 = ~If I had to guess which dark deity was your parent, I would probably have said Loviatar instead, my love. 'Fear her and yet long for her.' No doubt half the world does one or the other.~
@2385 = ~(Adrian has pulled a recently acquired tome of magical theory out of his pack, and while he at first seems deeply engrossed in his reading, you notice after a moment that he hasn't turned a page for ten minutes. He glances up, his eyes finding you almost unconsciously, before shaking his head and turning his attention back to the book.)~
@2386 = ~Mmm, I was thinking of this festhall in Selgaunt I would have liked to have been able to show you. They had dancers from as far away as Mulhorand, and the fertility rites of Isis...~
@2387 = ~Well, perhaps it would not have been completely appropriate, but so few of the worthwhile things in life are.~
@2388 = ~(Adrian pulls you into his arms during a moment's break, brushing your hair aside to press his lips against the back of your neck.)~
@2389 = ~(You find Adrian watching you to<DAYNIGHT> with an audacity that is not entirely out of place for a drow wizard. He seems to be enjoying the role you have been assigned, and if he still feels anything for you but lust mingled with hatred, he is hiding it well.)~
@2390 = ~(Adrian's eyes sweep across the caverns, ever alert for dangers, and you notice how he displays both the alertness of one expecting violence and the casualness that only comes from long familiarity. His gaze meets yours, and the tension eases slightly from his face.)~
@2391 = ~(Adrian brushes against you, his fingers grazing against your skin. He draws away quickly, apologizing profusely for the slight, but he can't quite suppress a small, contented smile.)~
@2392 = ~(Adrian's eyes fall upon you, and he spends a long moment admiring your drow body. Smiling ruefully, he finally draws close enough to whisper.)~
@2393 = ~The clothing is... memorable, no doubt, but I find myself missing your true form almost as much as the sky, Veldrin.~
@2394 = ~Dammit! So many wizards and not a brain between them. They're fools to take a mage of that power alive.~
@2395 = ~Hells, what a <DAYNIGHT>! Could we find the nearest tavern, <CHARNAME>? I'd like to drown myself in wine for a while.~
@2396 = ~You would counsel revelry at a time such as this? Do not be a fool, Adrian.~
@2397 = ~If not at a time like this, then when?~
@2398 = ~The plague of the world, those elves! They're to blame, I tell you! They're to blame for everything!~
@2399 = ~Insipid, useless creatures, aren't they?~
@2400 = ~A supporter! Wait, you... you have elven blood! I can see its mark on you! Do you dare mock me!?~
@2401 = ~Hardly. Go crusading and I may well find you a barony somewhere.~
@2402 = ~See! Even their wretched spawn hates them! DEMONS! DEMONS, ALL OF THEM!~
@2403 = ~Nine Hells, how... utterly disgraceful.~
@2404 = ~You! Have you ever been cheated, here? I bet ye have!~
@2405 = ~Honestly, I'm used to worse.~
@2406 = ~I've...heard of powerful enough illusions being capable of such things, but I've never quite seen it. Who is this Kalah anyway?~
@2407 = ~He's an illusionist, but... no! He shouldn't be capable of this!~
@2408 = ~If you're buying someone a drink, <CHARNAME>, I'd much rather it be me.~
@2409 = ~Bah! Ye can has some too.~
@2410 = ~<CHARNAME>... is this really necessary?~
@2411 = ~As low as my expectations of the Amnish nobility were, perhaps I should lower them further.~
@2412 = ~I take it <CHARNAME>'s own monetary needs are irrelevant, or do you plan on whining at the Shadow Thieves as well? By all means, go ahead. It should prove entertaining, at least.~
@2413 = ~Mm, that's quite the sum. Almost too good to be true, but certainly worth the hassle.~
@2414 = ~Spoken like a true tyrant, my lady Harper.~
@2415 = ~Direct your venom elsewhere, mage.~
@2416 = ~Beautifully done, <CHARNAME>.~
@2417 = ~COMING!!!~
@2418 = ~This... charming little establishment just got considerably more interesting. Shall we, my <LADYLORD>?~
@2419 = ~(hurrrm) The Copper Coronet aims to please... a customer with coin to spend.~
@2420 = ~Sell your no doubt damaged goods to those who can't afford better, woman.~
@2421 = ~I see. Perhaps you should reconsider where you are then...and remember not to bother other customers with your puerile attitude.~
@2422 = ~Purchased employees? At least have the courage to call it what it is.~
@2423 = ~Unbent, unbroken...after everything. Not that it has done him any good. Do what you will, <CHARNAME>. I care not.~
@2424 = ~Unlikely. New slavers will have moved in before the week is over, but I am not... adverse to paying these ones a short visit.~
@2425 = ~You don't remember me, I see. No matter, I wasn't very memorable at the time. Once your corpse is cold, I expect to find you equally forgettable.~
@2426 = ~You! The Moonsea scum I barely managed to sell off last time! What is going on here!?~
@2427 = ~Well, it may well serve to get some of them home, if they can hold onto it long enough. The rest will no doubt end up as thieves, whores, or slaves in Calimshan. A glorious victory, <CHARNAME>.~
@2428 = ~That's n-not true!~
@2429 = ~And thus they shall no doubt end up as thieves, whores, or slaves in Calimshan. A glorious victory indeed, <CHARNAME>.~
@2430 = ~Heroes? It would have been kinder by far to find the children a new master than to set them loose upon a foreign city with no means whatsoever. But I imagine a coddled knight such as yourself hasn't the life experience to understand that.~
@2431 = ~Hold your tongue, fiend, lest I cut it out for you. That you would suggest selling innocent children into slavery once more is despicable, though I find it less and less surprising.~
@2432 = ~There once was a mage from the keep,
who followed his lords like a sheep.
His city in ashes,
a new life he snatches,
is it wisdom or ruin he'll reap?~
@2433 = ~And you wonder why I hate poetry! How in the hells--~
@2434 = ~And no amount of money might change your mind?~
@2435 = ~I'm afraid not, my lord.~
@2436 = ~Skill, certainly. Intelligence, apparently not.~
@2437 = ~Ye best b' careful with that bearin', friend. I'd hates t' see ye on me table one day... well... mayhap I'd like it a' that, aye?~
@2438 = ~You'd best get in line.~
@2439 = ~HEY! Half-elf, don't you think I can't see you eyeing that coat! Yeah, I know it's pretty. You touch it, you'll be paying a price in blood!~
@2440 = ~Ah... my apologies.~
@2441 = ~I find that exceptionally hard to believe.~
@2442 = ~They always do, don't they?~
@2443 = ~A position with the Shadow Thieves... it's a fine offer, <CHARNAME>.~
@2444 = ~Yes, yes. The choice is ultimately <CHARNAME>'s.~
@2445 = ~Do reconsider, <CHARNAME>. The Shadow Thieves make for powerful friends. You could do much worse.~
@2446 = ~Ah... the favor of the Shadow Thieves and a classic infiltration mission. Perhaps I shall find Athkatla to my liking after all.~
@2447 = ~Just remember, <CHARNAME>: you are a Shadow Thief now. You care about wealth and power, and you obey your masters without protest. Nothing is more important to you than success and advancement. The subtleties of...morality have little place in your world.~
@2448 = ~Advice to take to heart... if you could afford to have one now.~
@2449 = ~What, do you think your hands will be less bloody if you don't carry out the execution yourself? Don't be a fool, <CHARNAME>, and don't throw away good money.~
@2450 = ~Well done. Tying yourself this closely with the Shadow Thieves can only help our chances of success in Amn. Hopefully.~
@2451 = ~Heh. I doubt the Lathandrites would ever notice it's gone.~
@2452 = ~Hmm. I doubt a god like Talos would be offended by such trivial matters anyway.~
@2453 = ~A rather odd place for a Red Wizard.~
@2454 = ~I would not expect a second rate spellcaster to discern the aspirations that motivate one such as myself.~
@2455 = ~Eliminating a Red Wizard's rival... lovely. It is nice to see the Shadow Thieves putting their resources towards such valuable tasks.~
@2456 = ~Bah! You are hardly worthy of such distinguished work!~
@2457 = ~Courting a Westhavian guild? In Athkatla? Audacious, if insane.~
@2458 = ~Silence, fool.~
@2459 = ~We don't need the Red Wizard, <CHARNAME>. He has the social skills of a viper and as much a taste for treachery. You'd be better off without his dubious magical talents.~
@2460 = ~Dubious? Don't think I did not hear that, oaf.~
@2461 = ~I hope you're not actually considering sparing the fool, <CHARNAME>.~
@2462 = ~I haven't noticed any likely spies, but that doesn't mean that none exist. You're playing a dangerous game, with dangerous people. This isn't the time to decide you don't like the stakes, <CHARNAME>. Any misstep is likely to get all of us killed.~
@2463 = ~As for the the thief... he's no innocent bystander. He's a Shadow Thief, a profession he's always known might one day cost him everything. Don't forget that.~
@2464 = ~My, Harper, you certainly know how to make friends.~
@2465 = ~And thus do we draw the Harpers' attention...and for little or no true purpose. Any information this Xzar knows was probably shared by the voices in his head.~
@2466 = ~Bah! Complain if you want. So long as you do as you're told, I care not.~
@2467 = ~For once I agree with the Harper. This is a conflict I'd rather stay as far away from as possible.~
@2468 = ~And our grand reward... a knife in the back, no doubt.~
@2469 = ~Well, well... it's not quite Twilight Hall, but I suppose it'll do.~
@2470 = ~For being such proponents of individuality, it really is just the same nonsense over and over again, isn't it?~
@2471 = ~They've no doubt already killed the fool.~
@2472 = ~Lucky us. Even for Harpers, this is convoluted.~
@2473 = ~I don't like this, <CHARNAME>. I don't like this at all.~
@2474 = ~I'm sorry, but *what*?~
@2475 = ~You have nothing to fear, Zhent. You are not as interesting as you think you are. It is <CHARNAME> whom they wish to see.~
@2476 = ~Do not interrupt, Adrian. It is <CHARNAME> whom they wish to see.~
@2477 = ~Majesty? Your damned Dark Sun doesn't know his head from his arse. Granted, from the looks of it, neither do you.~
@2478 = ~BLASPHEMER! TRAITOR! RRRRAAAAAAGH!~
@2479 = ~Paladins, smuggling slaves? Oh, where is a proper bard when you need one?~
@2480 = ~I've had enough of witch-hunts... <CHARNAME>, please. Do something.~
@2481 = ~She would be a powerful ally, but for the inevitable betrayal.~
@2482 = ~You know nothing of treason, surfacer.~
@2483 = ~Of course. Only the suffering of the righteous matters.~
@2484 = ~Evil-doers have earned whatever misery befalls them tenfold, mage. It is little compared to the fate that awaits them in the Abyss.~
@2485 = ~To the hells with you too, paladin.~
@2486 = ~Oh... I don't plan on abusing it at all. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2487 = ~See to it that you don't.~
@2488 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'd rather not be helpless because you didn't want to spend a bit of gold. Unless you plan on taking down the whole damn order.~
@2489 = ~Words are tricky things... if he plays you fair, so be it. If not, I dare say he has broken the contract himself.~
@2490 = ~Killing the fool may prove kinder. I'm not adverse to courting the Cowled Wizards a bit more, <CHARNAME>, whether or not this story be true.~
@2491 = ~Village? Can't we go find someone who can pay instead?~
@2492 = ~P-p-please...~
@2493 = ~Excuse me, half-elf? My lord husband has been searching for a new manservant and you--~
@2494 = ~You... you hit me! You barbaric peasant!~
@2495 = ~If your face scars, that was probably the signet ring. We like them sharp back home.~
@2496 = ~You there! Half-elf! I have been searching for a new manservant and you--~
@2497 = ~You! Another elven spy in our midst, no doubt!~
@2498 = ~Oh, yes. I plan to bring all your worthless secrets back to Myth Drannor. Well, what's left of it, at least.~
@2499 = ~I'd love the see the look on the priests' faces if we brought the fool's corpse back instead. Granted, they could just raise him again.~
@2500 = ~I may not particularly care for the Morninglord, but working against upstart gods... *that* is a task to be relished.~
@2501 = ~...it's almost like being home again. Still, working against upstart gods... *that* is a task to be relished.~
@2502 = ~I may not worship Helm, but working against upstart gods... *that* is a task to be relished.~
@2503 = ~Let him serve the greater good *elsewhere*, <CHARNAME>.~
@2504 = ~A beholder cult? Here? Interesting.~
@2505 = ~First, shameless deicide, and now long lost artifacts of immense power... I'm enjoying this quest more and more.~
@2506 = ~Do not let lust for power get the better of you, mage, unless you wish a fate such as ours.~
@2507 = ~Haven't ye got yer own silly elven gods to pray to? Why do they let ye in here with the true believers anyway?~
@2508 = ~I have no interest in the Seldarine. Be glad Azuth doesn't condone the reckless use of magic... you'd be on fire right now if he did.~
@2509 = ~Granted, if I can just pay my way back into his favor, I may make an exception.~
@2510 = ~I... ah...~
@2511 = ~Hells, <CHARNAME>. At least save your generosity for someone slightly more convincing.~
@2512 = ~Bah! Shut your trap, mage!~
@2513 = ~Oh, this is almost comically stupid.~
@2514 = ~Better to see than to experience. This isn't religiously inspired, is it?~
@2515 = ~No, there is no evidence that the intent here is sacrifice. No evidence of any clear intent at all.~
@2516 = ~Circumstances beyond one's control... such as lack of talent, perhaps?~
@2517 = ~Listen to this nonsense. If you can't compete, stay away from the damn game.~
@2518 = ~Loath as I am to admit it, the Red Wizard has a point.~
@2519 = ~You... half-elf, ye looks a bit familiar. Do I know ye?~
@2520 = ~...I hope you're not implying that we all look alike.~
@2521 = ~Bah! Close enough.~
@2522 = ~Hmm. You should have kept your mouth shut, friend.~
@2523 = ~Er... no, no I don't think so.  I must be going, actually...~
@2524 = ~I see.  A Zhentarim agent, if I recall, but one of no consequence.  Pay him no heed, <CHARNAME>.~
@2525 = ~Well, aren't you a pretty one, half-elf? Would you care to--~
@2526 = ~Laugh in your face? I'm certainly about to.~
@2527 = ~You know... it's a shame that they let mages walk the streets! Those sorcerers shouldn't be allowed to show their faces!~
@2528 = ~Keep it up, woman, and you won't have a face to show at all.~
@2529 = ~You... you look so angry, sir! You're not a murderer, are you?~
@2530 = ~Not in this country, no. I could change that if you'd like.~
@2531 = ~MY MOTHER SAYS THAT SORCERERS ARE DEMONS THAT SHOULD BE BURNT AT THE STAKE.~
@2532 = ~How very creative of her. You'd best wander off before I give her another reason to say that.~
@2533 = ~Why don't you crawl into a hole and die, my lord Feveron? I'd be happy to help you along.~
@2534 = ~Why, I never!~
@2535 = ~My lady, these peasants simply do not know their places!~
@2536 = ~My place? My place is leagues higher than yours, you inbred southern freak, I can assure you of that much.~
@2537 = ~You dare insult my ancestry, peasant? Do you have any idea who--~
@2538 = ~My lord... my lord, perhaps it's best--~
@2539 = ~This whole damn country is a joke, my lord Feveron, but you... unless you're descended from the king of old Netheril, I don't give a damn who you are. And even a lineage like that...~
@2540 = ~Eek!~
@2541 = ~Adrian! Adrian, that is enough! You will cease this madness immediately.~
@2542 = ~Did you honestly just jump me, paladin!? Get your hands off of me!~
@2543 = ~Not until you have regained your senses. I shall not allow you to murder these people.~
@2544 = ~Adrian! Adrian, that is enough. Stop it this minute!~
@2545 = ~Did you honestly just jump me, halfling!? You're half my size! Get your hands off of me!~
@2546 = ~I may be half your size, but I shall not allow you to murder these people. Come to your senses!~
@2547 = ~Adrian, that is enough. You will not hurt these people.~
@2548 = ~Get your hands off of me, Harper!~
@2549 = ~Not until you have come to your senses. Assuming you even have any.~
@2550 = ~(grab him before he can cast something)~
@2551 = ~Oh, this should be good.~
@2552 = ~Ow! Get your hands off me, <CHARNAME>! I...~
@2553 = ~Fine, fine. I won't kill the bastard. Let's just... get out of here.~
@2554 = ~I warned you you would start a riot, my lord!~
@2555 = ~<CHARNAME>, leave it to the garrison. They're paid to handle this sort of nonsense. We have better things to do.~
@2556 = ~Larger than life... if they're lucky, they won't live to regret it.~
@2557 = ~Unless you want to die horribly, my lady, I'd recommend it.~
@2558 = ~Hmm. Little wonder the wizards proved less than forthcoming. They're dangerous people to cross, <CHARNAME>, though I suppose a longer game could prove... profitable. Be careful.~
@2559 = ~Unless it cost more than this whole village, I'm unimpressed.~
@2560 = ~Folk legend? If anything, it's someone taking advantage of folk legend. Let the famous knight handle it, <CHARNAME>. That's what they're good for.~
@2561 = ~Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. Your family will have finally fallen to a state fitting its timid nature, it would seem.~
@2562 = ~In some parts of the world, the two are indistinguishable, though I'd hardly expect such sense from an inbred southern dilettante. Show the proper respect when addressing your betters, woman, or you may yet find yourself decorating the slave quarters of a Calishite pasha.~
@2563 = ~Must I ever be subjected to such coarse manners? Your threats do not interest me in the slightest, peasant.~
@2564 = ~...hells, sometimes I wish I still worshiped a god who condoned the spectacular misuse of magic.~
@2565 = ~Your petty concerns are of little enough value to one of my station. I believe I was speaking with your employer.~
@2566 = ~I can't decide whether you're mad or stupid, though I suppose I shouldn't expect more from an inbred southern dilettante. Show the proper respect when addressing your betters, woman, or you may yet find yourself decorating the slave quarters of a Calishite pasha.~
@2567 = ~Ha! We're off to rescue the princess now, I hope? If only to wipe that ugly sneer off of dear Mister Roenal's face? I'm sure a man like that leaves a paper trail a mile long, out of sheer stupidity if nothing else.~
@2568 = ~Ha! That's really quite clever.~
@2569 = ~It is, is it not?~
@2570 = ~(smile) We might as well help this poor merchant town in its hour of need, <CHARNAME>. I dare say its pockets are deep enough.~
@2571 = ~What say you, <CHARNAME>?~
@2572 = ~Peace? What is peace worth in the end? Let the so-called nobles kill each other if they can't control themselves... no real loss, I suspect.~
@2573 = ~A lovely mental image, if ever there was one.~
@2574 = ~Ha! This Lord Menold talks well, for a pompous bastard, but I doubt he has half as much to offer as Coprith, or that he'll remember his former friends even if he does come to power. If you want to play this game for the sheer entertainment value, though, I won't try to stop you.~
@2575 = ~Hmph. I shall let that pass.~
@2576 = ~There is much anger in you, half-elf, forged into a weapon you would use to keep at bay those who need not be your foes. Take care, lest you turn it upon yourself.~
@2577 = ~Neither you nor your vague threats impress me, charlatan.~
@2578 = ~Hells! To be taken in by such an illusion!~
@2579 = ~A common enough tactic.~
@2580 = ~Hells! That... dragon... ancient dragon...~
@2581 = ~As I said, <CHARNAME>, both you and your... courageous companions have come to bore me.~
@2582 = ~If the ancient red dragon doesn't want a fight, <CHARNAME>, I'd happily refrain...~
@2583 = ~You are a brave one, are you not? One wonders where you find the courage even to run.~
@2584 = ~I can believe it. Step carefully, <CHARNAME>, we're dealing with the powers that be now.~
@2585 = ~Yes. Don't doubt that for a moment.~
@2586 = ~Oh, I would happily take a look at those. Hopefully they're even worthwhile.~
@2587 = ~You *charge* us to perform services for you, Shadow Master? That's bold.~
@2588 = ~A simple task, if ever there was one. I do appreciate the lack of dungeons.~
@2589 = ~Hunting traitors, are we? Well, better than the reverse.~
@2590 = ~A fortress prison for mages... of course. Wonderful.~
@2591 = ~Be careful, <CHARNAME>. I know a vampire when I see one, even if this one is... stranger than most.~
@2592 = ~Don't do it, <CHARNAME>. She'll drain you dry and leave you for dead when she's finished using you.~
@2593 = ~From a man like you, that is quite the accusation, sorcerer. Be silent.~
@2594 = ~From a man like you, that is quite the accusation, wizard. Be silent.~
@2595 = ~The vampire sends us to rescue a man? I wonder what he knows.~
@2596 = ~Oh. Well, that's not so terrible.~
@2597 = ~Kill the Shadow Master? That's... ambitious.~
@2598 = ~I would have liked to have known of this caveat earlier.~
@2599 = ~Your time of choice has long since passed.~
@2600 = ~A fortress prison for mages... of course. First she wants us to spare her wretched brother, and now... this.~
@2601 = ~As simple a task as breathing, no doubt.~
@2602 = ~Well, yes. They are none too intelligent.~
@2603 = ~She's lucky he hasn't killed her brother and forced her into prostitution anyway. Or worse. This Desharik likes his power games, I dare say. But then, who doesn't?~
@2604 = ~There's nothing quite like insane megalomania to make a man homesick.~
@2605 = ~I'm sure they are. <CHARNAME>, why are we even talking to these freaks?~
@2606 = ~I expected little from you, thief, but treachery such as this... rest assured, Yoshimo, there will be a special hell reserved for you!~
@2607 = ~Like a cat with a couple of mice, is it? You'll regret this, vampire. With your life.~
@2608 = ~So you say, but I very much doubt it will come to that.~
@2609 = ~Those lunatics are hardly my idea of a decent army, but magic is magic, and even a mad wizard can be of use.~
@2610 = ~You...you can take your own dreams of revenge with you to your grave, wizard! Ours has waited long enough!~
@2611 = ~Bah! Your pathetic mewlings mean even less to me than <CHARNAME>'s!~
@2612 = ~And you need our help now, no doubt. I'd sooner kill you and swim home.~
@2613 = ~...assuming the lunatic fish has anything of real value.~
@2614 = ~Do you win, at least?~
@2615 = ~What? Of course I win. Didn't I say that they were *imps*?~
@2616 = ~Then you're saner than you could be.~
@2617 = ~Thin spots in the boundaries between dimensions? That's considered heresy by most theorists, last I heard.~
@2618 = ~Indeed, it is. Incorrectly, I have come to believe. I spent several years before my imprisonment researching the particulars... a search that led me to this cavern.~
@2619 = ~Fascinating. <CHARNAME>, if we could stay here a bit longer, I'd like to see the results.~
@2620 = ~Do you know what plane you found there?~
@2621 = ~It is hard to say for certain, as the planes are infinite. This, I believe, was a demiplane, created long ago by a powerful wizard. Elven, I would hazard to guess, given the beauty of the place.~
@2622 = ~Elves are hardly the only ones capable of great beauty, you know.~
@2623 = ~Certainly not, though their high wizardry is immensely powerful, certainly potent enough to create a realm such as that.~
@2624 = ~Holy hells... try not to prod the dragon, <CHARNAME>.~
@2625 = ~Die wandering the Underdark or die on the altar of a temple of Lolth, is it?~
@2626 = ~I never promised that the task would be simple.~
@2627 = ~Oh, I like this. This could work.~
@2628 = ~Are you mad, man? What other type of adventure were you hoping to find in the Underdark? A Calishite carnaval?~
@2629 = ~It was foolish. I do not deny that.~
@2630 = ~Defeatism at its very best. Dammit. There *must* be a way out of this.~
@2631 = ~Hmm. It sounds better than the alternatives, at least.~
@2632 = ~Awakened? Oh, doesn't this sound delightful.~
@2633 = ~Watch your tongue, dwarf.~
@2634 = ~Har! An' here I thought ye two hated each other.~
@2635 = ~I would rebel here no more than I would back home, Veldrin. The very walls have eyes, I suspect.~
@2636 = ~Quaintly put, but accurate.~
@2637 = ~Foolish of them to live so close to a drow city in any case.~
@2638 = ~Exceedingly so.~
@2639 = ~I save my spells for the wretched surface elves. I have no desire to waste them in the pit, Veldrin.~
@2640 = ~Your patriotism does you credit, male, but you are a curiosity all the same.~
@2641 = ~You do not fear her vengeance in the hereafter, male?~
@2642 = ~Bah! It will come to me whether I seek it or no.~
@2643 = ~You'll gain no lasting favor from this, Veldrin, and we hardly need to risk the goddess's attentions.~
@2644 = ~I think not, Veldrin. I'll quite happily watch from the sidelines instead.~
@2645 = ~We haven't time to waste on this... frivolity. More pressing matters require our attention, male.~
@2646 = ~You don't say.~
@2647 = ~Obviously, your definition of "possibility" leaves much to be desired. As does your grasp of common courtesy, elf. So much for elven diplomacy, it would seem.~
@2648 = ~You know nothing of this situation, half-blood.~
@2649 = ~I have seen geas before, elf. More than once. I wouldn't have associated them with your type, but perhaps I'm closer in nature to my elven kin than I'd realized. A disturbing thought if ever there was one.~
@2650 = ~Another word from you, half-blood, and I will require a geas of you as well.~
@2651 = ~You rip out his soul and call his hatred petty? Elves. You're so lost in your own self-righteous, self-indulgent hypocrisy that you can't even recognize your enemies until they've set your cities afire.~
@2652 = ~Think what you may, but the Exile threatens innocents alongside those who harmed him.~
@2653 = ~<CHARNAME>? <CHARNAME>, are you all right?~
@2654 = ~I'll be fine. I'm just a bit faint.~
@2655 = ~I felt... out of control for a moment, but it passed.~
@2656 = ~It's nothing. Don't worry about it.~
@2657 = ~I see. That damn ritual, no doubt. We need to get out of here as quickly as possible, I think.~
@2658 = ~<CHARNAME>, are you... are you still there? That was Bhaal's avatar...~
@2659 = ~We need to get your soul back as soon as possible; that may have been the only thing keeping that... thing in check.~
@2660 = ~<CHARNAME>? <CHARNAME>, wake up, you...~
@2661 = ~Get back! Before I kill you! I can't stop this!~
@2662 = ~Something's... something's happening, I...~
@2663 = ~Don't touch me! I...~
@2664 = ~Your lips are moving but... <CHARNAME>? I... oh, hells--~
@2665 = ~...you're not getting rid of me that easily, <CHARNAME>.~
@2666 = ~I shouldn't joke about it, I know, but... come on. We need to get out of here and find help wherever we can before you lose control entirely.~
@2667 = ~And dead... finally, gloriously dead, but... <CHARNAME>?~
@2668 = ~Adrian, your mercurial half-elven lover. The road for you has been rocky at times, but his eyes are calm as he regards you now.~
@2669 = ~Adrian... I ---~
@2670 = ~Adrian, the mercurial half-elven mage. You know that you have slowly won his trust, but will his faith stand in the face of what is to come?~
@2671 = ~You can still walk away from this, Adrian. It isn't your fight anymore.~
@2672 = ~You've seen how powerful Irenicus is, Adrian. You understand the dangers as well as anyone does. You don't need to do this.~
@2673 = ~Can you still handle this, Adrian? I need to know that you're not faltering now.~
@2674 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>. And as much as I'd rather stand here and talk right now... come, let's finish this.~
@2675 = ~It never really was, was it? A not-so-innocent bystander in a game between gods... that's all I've ever been. But I haven't abandoned you yet, <CHARNAME>, and I won't turn and run now.~
@2676 = ~No? As much as I might enjoy watching Irenicus burn this tree to cinders, I want his head more.~
@2677 = ~And leave you to face him alone? I haven't abandoned you yet, <CHARNAME>, and I won't turn and run now.~
@2678 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, I do. And as much as I might enjoy watching Irenicus burn this tree to cinders, I want his head more.~
@2679 = ~I haven't abandoned you yet, <CHARNAME>, and I certainly won't turn and run now.~
@2680 = ~The Nine Hells... not the afterlife I've been hoping for, but I've followed you this far, <CHARNAME>, I might as well follow you a little longer...~
@2681 = ~The Nine Hells... not the afterlife I've been hoping for, but I won't abandon you now, <CHARNAME>, even at the end...~
@2682 = ~Get used to the Nine Hells, wizard. There's nothing left for you but this.~
@2683 = ~Nine Hells, <PRO_MANWOMAN>, have you no sense of discretion whatsoever? Continue drawing attention like this and we'll soon be hunted throughout the entire country. At least go bribe the nearest church. Last I heard, heroes respect that sort of thing.~
@2684 = ~I can't say I mind being loved and admired and given special discounts, but don't you think you're taking this "heroics" thing a little bit too far? You're likely to get us all killed.~
@2685 = ~Veldrin?~
@2686 = ~What do you think of Ust Natha?~
@2687 = ~Are you enjoying the local scenery?~
@2688 = ~What are you thinking right now?~
@2689 = ~How do you think we're doing?~
@2690 = ~I'll be happy when this is over.~
@2691 = ~Turn your insolent gaze elsewhere, male. Your attention has grown tiresome.~
@2692 = ~Entertain me, male. Don't pretend you don't like what you see.~
@2693 = ~(Flirt with him.)~
@2694 = ~(Say nothing.)~
@2695 = ~(You glance at Adrian and find him tense and withdrawn. It is unlikely that he will react well to questioning at the moment.)~
@2696 = ~(Adrian glances in your direction.)~
@2697 = ~Do you think I should work with the Shadow Thieves or with Valen's mysterious mistress?~
@2698 = ~Do you have any advice for me?~
@2699 = ~Could I ask you a question?~
@2700 = ~Could I speak with you?~
@2701 = ~Do you simply plan on staring, <CHARNAME>, or did you have something to say?~
@2702 = ~Could I ask you what you think of someone?~
@2703 = ~Could I ask you something a bit silly?~
@2704 = ~Not at all.~
@2705 = ~Did you want something, <CHARNAME>?~
@2706 = ~How exactly did you get sold into slavery?~
@2707 = ~Where are you from?~
@2708 = ~You don't seem to be an adventurer by profession. What do you normally do?~
@2709 = ~How many places have you been in your life?~
@2710 = ~What was your childhood like?~
@2711 = ~So, you and I...~
@2712 = ~That depends on the question.~
@2713 = ~You seemed rather familiar with Tanya. Did you two used to know each other?~
@2714 = ~Tell me about Talsar Soargyl.~
@2715 = ~What was Zhentil Keep really like?~
@2716 = ~Could you tell me anything about the Zhentarim?~
@2717 = ~You worship Azuth, right? The Lord of Spells? What is it like being in a country where magic is illegal?~
@2718 = ~Could you tell me a bit more about your family?~
@2719 = ~Your cousins who got sold into slavery... dare I ask what really happened to them?~
@2720 = ~You mentioned a shortlived political marriage... could you tell me more about that?~
@2721 = ~Never mind.~
@2722 = ~Of course.~
@2723 = ~This isn't exactly what I was expecting out of life.~
@2724 = ~Have you ever thought of getting married?~
@2725 = ~Losing my soul... I'm lucky I survived that ritual at all.~
@2726 = ~I can't stop worrying about Imoen.~
@2727 = ~After everything, do you think Imoen will be okay?~
@2728 = ~I'm getting very tired of these constant nightmares.~
@2729 = ~I wish none of this had happened. Sarevok. Irenicus. Everything.~
@2730 = ~You'd think I'd be used to things like this by now, but I'm really not. Every day I just feel more overwhelmed by everything.~
@2731 = ~Do you really think we're going to get through this alive?~
@2732 = ~Would you care to share my bed tonight?~
@2733 = ~What do I have to do to get you into my bed?~
@2734 = ~I appreciate the attention, but could you not flirt with me in public?~
@2735 = ~I know it's somewhat exhibitionistic, but I enjoy your attention. Could you flirt with me more?~
@2736 = ~I don't think this relationship is working out. I'm sorry.~
@2737 = ~Extraordinarily bad luck.~
@2738 = ~Sembia, fairly recently. It's a great country for wizards who are happy enough getting their hands dirty. Half the country is spying on the other half or trying to poison it.~
@2739 = ~It's quite the melting pot as well, with traders from as far away as Mulhorand wandering in to do business.~
@2740 = ~I suppose I'm fairly well traveled, at least when it comes to the lands just west of the Inland Sea. Sembia, the Dales. Cormyr.~
@2741 = ~I've been involved in a few things over the past decade or so... politics back home, a bit of... commercial consulting, shall we say, and a few other things. A pseudo-military stint that wasn't exactly pleasant. That one I don't miss.~
@2742 = ~The Shadow Thieves. They're less likely to stab you in the back afterwards.~
@2743 = ~Whatever you might think of them, nine times out of ten the monster you know is better than the one waiting in the shadows, and they haven't burnt down Athkatla just yet.~
@2744 = ~The sum might seem large, but it's not the gold that concerns me. That mage... if we're going to match him, we need power. Magic. And as much of it as possible.~
@2745 = ~Make ourselves as useful to the thieves as possible. That shouldn't be terribly hard; they haven't proved entirely competent themselves, have they?~
@2746 = ~Get this nonsense over with as quickly as possible and pray for the best.~
@2747 = ~Mount that damn mage's head on a pike.~
@2748 = ~Try not to get eaten by these overgrown fish. It's a pity a Lightning Bolt wouldn't electrocute the whole lot of them.~
@2749 = ~Check every shadow for enemies and find a way back to the surface before we get killed.~
@2750 = ~Find whatever allies we can to throw at that vampire. Myself, I'd rather simply just watch.~
@2751 = ~I'd delay going after Irenicus again as long as possible to obtain more power, but we're playing by his rules, unfortunately, and time seems very much of the essence.~
@2752 = ~Don't walk into any walls on my account, <CHARNAME>.~
@2753 = ~Don't walk into any walls on my account, my dear.~
@2754 = ~(smile) The things you don't know about me could fill up all the shelves in Candlekeep, my lady.~
@2755 = ~Not right now, <CHARNAME>.~
@2756 = ~I'd prefer a bit more order and less arbitrary capriciousness myself.~
@2757 = ~It makes me strangely nostalgic, truth be told.~
@2758 = ~Needless to say, I'd prefer a magocracy.~
@2759 = ~I'm surprised they don't have as strict a law against the use of magic here as they do back home, though. But perhaps the thought of their males rebelling is unthinkable.~
@2760 = ~Not particularly. Very little about Ust Natha speaks well for the populace's imagination.~
@2761 = ~It is surprisingly beautiful. In its own way.~
@2762 = ~It does keep one's wits sharply honed, doesn't it?~
@2763 = ~I revere Lolth as much as the next disenfranchised male, but... well.~
@2764 = ~I'm honored that you would even think to ask, Malla Veldrin.~
@2765 = ~About priestesses, shockingly enough.~
@2766 = ~About my long and exciting history with blasphemy.~
@2767 = ~Inevitable treachery.~
@2768 = ~I'd be happier if you hadn't just asked that question.~
@2769 = ~Better than I would have expected.~
@2770 = ~What we lack in training, we make up for in desperation, I suppose.~
@2771 = ~Phaere has little enough reason to be displeased, I should think.~
@2772 = ~So will I, actually.~
@2773 = ~Missing Ched Nasad, are we? I don't blame you.~
@2774 = ~Call it villainy or call it flavor, I suppose.~
@2775 = ~It is a bit exhausting by anyone's standards.~
@2776 = ~Before or after it got smashed to pieces?~
@2777 = ~No, I suppose that isn't fair. Shall I tell you about the paladins at the gates... or the lichs in their crypts, perhaps? Though I suppose we have a few of those here in Amn as well.~
@2778 = ~Could you tell me what it was like to actually live there?~
@2779 = ~Paladins at the gates? I can't even tell if that's hyperbole.~
@2780 = ~Lichs in their crypts? Is that really an issue there?~
@2781 = ~I've heard less than pleasant things about the people from that part of the world in general.~
@2782 = ~I'd personally rather hear about its taverns and festhalls.~
@2783 = ~If you're going to resent it, I'll leave you alone.~
@2784 = ~I dare say that depends upon who you are. It was a rich city... back when it was still a city, at least. You'd never know it, of course. The lords hoarded away all of the money.~
@2785 = ~(smile) Not that I had anything to complain about in that regard.~
@2786 = ~And yet you seem to miss Sembia more.~
@2787 = ~I'm surprised you even had a lower class if you treated them so horrifically.~
@2788 = ~You still had money even after you angered your masters?~
@2789 = ~I can imagine what the city guard was like.~
@2790 = ~You're not at all ashamed to be from a place that corrupt?~
@2791 = ~Perhaps I shouldn't ask.~
@2792 = ~Yes, well. Sembia is certainly an easier place to live, regardless of social class. If I had actually had more of a choice in the matter...~
@2793 = ~But there's no point in considering that. Needless to say, I preferred the Keep before the Time of Troubles.~
@2794 = ~Well... by and large, they wouldn't be able to afford to leave. The exit toll is not exactly cheap, and it wasn't safe outside of the city. Not that it was particularly safe inside of it either.~
@2795 = ~In any case, it isn't as if we made no concessions. They haven't had to pay any taxes since the last time they were overtaxed and tried to flee the city en masse.~
@2796 = ~Ahh... well. My grandmother was still alive at that point. And still rich. I might not have had much of an opportunity to use that money, but I wasn't exactly disowned.~
@2797 = ~...brutal. Hilariously so, when they weren't down south attacking Hillsfar or the Dalelands.~
@2798 = ~You know, it's been said that we're such aggressive expansionists because once upon a time, the lords needed to find reasons to keep their armies out of the city itself. I can certainly believe it.~
@2799 = ~It is what it is. What would be the point?~
@2800 = ~Perhaps not.~
@2801 = ~My... delightful former home isn't really my favorite topic of conversation, <CHARNAME>, so if you have any other questions, you might as well ask them now.~
@2802 = ~You mentioned paladins at the gates before... I can't even tell if that's hyperbole.~
@2803 = ~You said something about lichs in their crypts? Is that really an issue there?~
@2804 = ~Tell me about its taverns and festhalls.~
@2805 = ~Well, it isn't very far from. We aren't particularly fond of adventurers back home. They tend to like to cause problems.~
@2806 = ~Is that why you hate the concept of adventuring so much?~
@2807 = ~How often do they cause problems?~
@2808 = ~I'm sure you had enough problems of your own without worrying about that too.~
@2809 = ~I suppose the hunt for evil isn't particularly difficult in a place like that.~
@2810 = ~I suppose it may be part of it. Not that all adventurers are mindless do-gooders... yourself, for instance, but more often than not it tends to be the assumption.~
@2811 = ~I suppose it may be part of it. Not that all adventurers are mindless do-gooders... no offense intended. Still, more often than not it tends to be the assumption.~
@2812 = ~Occasionally. It's not particular easy to get in or out of the city, and the guards at the gates are ever on the lookout for Harper spies and the like.~
@2813 = ~That's a bit of an understatement at this point.~
@2814 = ~Turn a corner and charge at the nearest person, is it? I'm sure it happened occasionally.~
@2815 = ~As much as I enjoy the thought of paladins and other... wonderful people wandering my former city, if you have any other questions, you might as well ask them now.~
@2816 = ~You said something about lichs in their crypts? Is that really an issue there as well?~
@2817 = ~Tell me about the taverns and festhalls.~
@2818 = ~It certainly isn't much of a priority currently, but... well, if you'd care for a ghost story, I'd be happy to indulge.~
@2819 = ~Crazy folk tales, is it? Please do share.~
@2820 = ~I think I'll pass on that.~
@2821 = ~I wouldn't say we have a problem, per se, but once, several centuries ago... we call them Those Who Walk By Night.~
@2822 = ~They were once the original mage-lords of the city, or so it's said. But like so many mages, particularly of the darker variety, they weren't content to simply surrender to death. And so they slipped beneath the city and into undeath instead, and for a time, they disappeared. And then they started to go mad.~
@2823 = ~In their insanity, they began wandering the city by night, committing acts that even by our standards were vile. All in the name of research. The city's lords protected themselves with powerful magics, but the citizenry... well, life has never been particularly kind to the commoners of Zhentil Keep.~
@2824 = ~When trade began to suffer, though... then the lords finally decided they cared, and the lichs disappeared one by one. Slain or simply in hiding once more, nobody can say for certain.~
@2825 = ~Some say that when the last lords of the city are slain, the lichs will walk once more... superstitious nonsense, of course, but stranger things have happened.~
@2826 = ~I'm going to have to remember this.~
@2827 = ~I hope you don't have your sights set on lichdom as well.~
@2828 = ~Well, there were dopplegangers hidden beneath Candlekeep once upon a time, but only because the Iron Throne put them there.~
@2829 = ~It's nice to know that your city was always completely mad.~
@2830 = ~That's the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.~
@2831 = ~I suppose no collection of ghost stories is complete without it.~
@2832 = ~...not particularly, no.~
@2833 = ~Actually, we're not quite as enamored of it as, say, Thayvians. Perhaps that story is part of why.~
@2834 = ~Ha! You'll need to tell me more about that someday, <CHARNAME>. But for now...~
@2835 = ~I'd prefer to call it colorful, but whatever you'd like.~
@2836 = ~You must have been very, very secluded in Candlekeep, then.~
@2837 = ~Do you simply enjoy throwing mindless stereotypes at me, or are you trying to say something?~
@2838 = ~I suppose I could have phrased that better.~
@2839 = ~Oh, calm down. Is everyone from the Moonsea so touchy?~
@2840 = ~If I were trying to say something, you would know.~
@2841 = ~Sullen, moody, and unfriendly. If you have a problem with the stereotype, perhaps you shouldn't embody it so completely.~
@2842 = ~...never mind.~
@2843 = ~Quite possibly.~
@2844 = ~Well, if you're going to offend someone, it's best to do it during the winter. It's harder to toss someone into the sea when it's frozen over.~
@2845 = ~How very unsubtle of you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2846 = ~But relying on stereotypes can be dangerous, <CHARNAME>. You never can tell when they'll *stop* being accurate.~
@2847 = ~And the wicked, wicked things that went on within?~
@2848 = ~Absolutely.~
@2849 = ~It can't all be that bad.~
@2850 = ~Decadence hardly counts as wickedness.~
@2851 = ~You really aren't going to take this at all seriously, are you?~
@2852 = ~Most of them weren't even worth visiting, truth be told. Ruined by the cruder elements of society. The festhalls, though... those tended to be pleasant enough.~
@2853 = ~No, there are some halfway decent places. Well, there were, at least, prior to the Razing. People who murder their patrons tend not to do good business.~
@2854 = ~You've never entertained with the clergy of Loviatar, have you?~
@2855 = ~Most of the inns weren't even worth visiting, truth be told. Ruined by the cruder elements of society. The festhalls, though... those tended to be pleasant enough.~
@2856 = ~You know me so well.~
@2857 = ~But my... delightful former home isn't really my favorite topic of conversation, <CHARNAME>, so if you have any other questions, you might as well ask them now.~
@2858 = ~Not a terrible idea.~
@2859 = ~I never slept with her, if that's what you're asking. She was an... acquaintance of the family, back before she became a Cyricist. Back before Cyric was even a god, technically.~
@2860 = ~And bare our dark, dark secrets to the world?~
@2861 = ~Don't be so defensive. You don't owe them anything.~
@2862 = ~You're really not one for gossip, are you?~
@2863 = ~Could you at least tell me if you knew Montaron and Xzar?~
@2864 = ~Do you even regret it at all?~
@2865 = ~Fine. Keep your secrets.~
@2866 = ~On the contrary, I'd say I owe them a great deal... though nothing particularly pleasant.~
@2867 = ~That would depend upon the gossip, I should think.~
@2868 = ~No, I didn't. And from what I've seen, I can't count that as much of a loss.~
@2869 = ~Now that's something of a loaded question, isn't it? I regret the way it ended, but beyond that... hmm.~
@2870 = ~If I cared much for sharing stories, I'd have taken up bardcraft instead.~
@2871 = ~Any old fool in a bar has a story or two to tell.~
@2872 = ~I really don't care for these mixed loyalties.~
@2873 = ~I'm glad you didn't. You're irritating enough as you are.~
@2874 = ~I guess I should expect secrecy from you by now.~
@2875 = ~Next time I feel like asking something, I'll remember to wait until you're completely drunk.~
@2876 = ~Yes, and I'd like to think that there's more separating them from myself than the quality of wine being ordered.~
@2877 = ~My loyalties are hardly mixed, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I suppose a lifetime of silence is just a hard habit to break.~
@2878 = ~How... kind of you to point that out, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@2879 = ~I doubt you'll have to wait very long for that.~
@2880 = ~It's really not a comfortable subject, <CHARNAME>. Eventually, perhaps, it will be, but certainly not to<DAYNIGHT>.~
@2881 = ~Irritating. I'm happy enough going underground for the latest writings in arcane theory, but it's still inconvenient. And ridiculous.~
@2882 = ~Is your church even active here?~
@2883 = ~You don't talk about your religion very much.~
@2884 = ~All things considered, I'd have expected you to worship a somewhat darker god than the Lord of Spells.~
@2885 = ~Bane to Azuth. How does that happen anyway?~
@2886 = ~I take it Azuthans aren't particularly interested in converts or crusades.~
@2887 = ~Are the latest writings really the only things that matter to you?~
@2888 = ~Not very much so, I suspect, though more than a handful of the Cowled Wizards are likely worshippers. I haven't really bothered to find out.~
@2889 = ~Utter religious secrecy is a difficult habit to break, I suppose, and those who didn't worship Cyric were not treated very well back home.~
@2890 = ~I suppose not. But then, utter religious secrecy is a difficult habit to break, and those who didn't worship Cyric were not treated very well back home.~
@2891 = ~I hope you don't expect me to comment on that one way or the other.~
@2892 = ~My priorities changed. Quite a bit. These things happen when you don't have to worry about disappointed elders sacrificing you at the altar one day.~
@2893 = ~Well, we're hardly Mystrans. We're quite happy to debate amongst ourselves and leave the pointless causes to those with more idealism than sense.~
@2894 = ~If you expect proselytizing, you'd best find another priest.~
@2895 = ~I survived it. That's the best that can be said about it.~
@2896 = ~You mentioned that you once ran away from home?~
@2897 = ~You must have at least some pleasant memories of it.~
@2898 = ~After being questioned on my past, I think I'm well within my rights to want to know more about yours.~
@2899 = ~You make that almost sound like an accomplishment.~
@2900 = ~I suppose I did mention that. A mistake on my part.~
@2901 = ~Could you at least tell me why?~
@2902 = ~Fine. I won't bother you about it.~
@2903 = ~Does almost killing one of my cousins in an explosion of sorcery count?~
@2904 = ~Should it?~
@2905 = ~I asked you for a pleasant memory, not something like that!~
@2906 = ~Is that why you once ran away?~
@2907 = ~So even as a child, you were a little monster.~
@2908 = ~Fine. Never mind.~
@2909 = ~Does accidentally almost killing my cousin with one of my uncle's wands count?~
@2910 = ~Is that what this is? Needless to say, I didn't grow up in Candlekeep, and I certainly didn't have a deranged Harper for a foster father.~
@2911 = ~Where did you grow up?~
@2912 = ~He'd have had to have been deranged to live in your home city.~
@2913 = ~But you had a family, I take it.~
@2914 = ~Even a deranged Harper would have raised you better than your own family clearly did.~
@2915 = ~I sometimes think it was.~
@2916 = ~My cousins... well, they were older than I was, and childhood rivalries... our grandfather encouraged them, to say the least. It weeds out the weak, he'd say, even though he hardly needed any excuses.~
@2917 = ~It was a long time ago, <CHARNAME>. It hardly matters now.~
@2918 = ~It's certainly the most pleasant memory I have of my cousins, at least.~
@2919 = ~(smile) Well, the second most pleasant.~
@2920 = ~They were older than I was, and childhood rivalries... our grandfather encouraged them, to say the least. It weeds out the weak, he'd say, even though he hardly needed any excuses.~
@2921 = ~No, not quite. My cousins... well, they were older than I was, and childhood rivalries... our grandfather encouraged them, to say the least. It weeds out the weak, he'd say, even though he hardly needed any excuses.~
@2922 = ~A little monster? (smile) I suppose I had to be. My cousins... well, they were older than I was, and childhood rivalries...~
@2923 = ~Our grandfather encouraged them, to say the least. It weeds out the weak, he'd say, even though he hardly needed any excuses.~
@2924 = ~Here and there. I spent quite some time in Deepingdale and Cormyr. Alas, the Crown wasn't too fond of me.~
@2925 = ~Don't think that we didn't catch Harpers wandering about every now and then.~
@2926 = ~That was always... exciting, even if the fallout was a bit more public than I would have liked.~
@2927 = ~I would tell you all about their terrible, terrible fates, but your own Harper hates me enough as it is.~
@2928 = ~Once upon a time.~
@2929 = ~(smile) Perish the thought.~
@2930 = ~There's not that much more to tell.~
@2931 = ~You haven't told me much of anything at all. Did your mother raise you?~
@2932 = ~You've mentioned your grandfather a time or two. Was your mother not around?~
@2933 = ~You history is hardly dull, you know. I'm sure you can think of something to add.~
@2934 = ~You can't honestly expect me to believe that. The son of a lord's daughter... what does that make you?~
@2935 = ~Not exactly. She was sent away again when I was eight or so years old. I haven't seen her since. After that... well, my uncles were around, more or less.~
@2936 = ~You aren't going to let this lie, are you? If you must know, my mother was sent away again when I was eight or so years old. I haven't seen her since. After that... well, my uncles were around, more or less.~
@2937 = ~Fabulously rich.~
@2938 = ~One was a lieutenant with the Zhentilar... a witless fool who'd cared more about his career than his own children, let alone me. Not that it got him very far in the end. His brother...~
@2939 = ~His brother took me on as an apprentice once my own talent for the Art became obvious. We... traveled quite a bit. For a time, at least.~
@2940 = ~Was he a sorcerer as well?~
@2941 = ~Was he a mage as well?~
@2942 = ~Do you know what happened to your mother?~
@2943 = ~Are any of your relatives still living?~
@2944 = ~An enchanter... amongst other things. I can't say he actually spent much time teaching me about the Art, but... well, I learned quite a bit in general. Nothing I would care to share, though.~
@2945 = ~Could you tell me if any of your relatives are still living?~
@2946 = ~No, I don't. I doubt she's even still alive, though I couldn't say for certain. Our enemies don't usually return the bodies. When somebody disappears, it can be difficult to know exactly why.~
@2947 = ~For once, I suppose that's something to be grateful for. Are we quite done here, <CHARNAME>?~
@2948 = ~I'll leave you alone, if that's what you want.~
@2949 = ~I honestly couldn't say. Most of them just disappeared at some point or another. Both of my uncles I know are dead; my two cousins...~
@2950 = ~The poor lads managed to get themselves sold to a Thayvian slave trader. They may yet be living.~
@2951 = ~That's terrible! I'm sorry to hear it.~
@2952 = ~I would hardly consider that a life.~
@2953 = ~*Both* of them?~
@2954 = ~I'm beginning to regret asking you at all.~
@2955 = ~Don't be. I most certainly am not.~
@2956 = ~I don't disagree. Not anymore.~
@2957 = ~(smile) Life in Zhentil Keep can be very dangerous.~
@2958 = ~(smile) My stories are hardly worse than your own, <CHARNAME>.~
@2959 = ~Nothing that they didn't have coming.~
@2960 = ~What did you do?~
@2961 = ~I suppose I really don't want to hear this.~
@2962 = ~If you must know... I was just shy of my twentieth birthday, recently returned from Cormyr. I was half mad at that point, mad enough to offer myself to the powers that be, more than mad enough to... well.~
@2963 = ~One of them said... something. I don't even remember exactly what. They'd said so many things over the years, it's difficult to keep them straight. I charmed them, I dragged them to the nearest slave trader... (smile) He happened to be from Thay.~
@2964 = ~The Keep is a dangerous place for a Red Wizard, but for a simple trader with coin to spend... well, it can be quite profitable.~
@2965 = ~You would do something like that to your own relatives?~
@2966 = ~You picked a Thayvian on purpose, didn't you?~
@2967 = ~I must admit, that's a creative way to settle a feud.~
@2968 = ~I really don't want to hear this anymore.~
@2969 = ~Coming from a <PRO_MANWOMAN> who killed <PRO_HISHER> own brother, that's delicious. What's blood next to years of hatred and abuse?~
@2970 = ~No remorse whatsoever, then?~
@2971 = ~At least I didn't have a choice.~
@2972 = ~Don't misunderstand me; I'm actually impressed.~
@2973 = ~Mmm, they do have quite the reputation, don't they? Nothing but the very best for my dear cousins. If they're lucky, they may yet be living on some farm in Thay, though I doubt they've lasted this long.~
@2974 = ~I'm surprised that the thought of selling people into slavery still gives you such pleasure.~
@2975 = ~It's a pity that there's no slaver in existence who could handle Irenicus.~
@2976 = ~Indeed. If my cousins are lucky, they may yet be living on some farm in Thay, though I very much doubt they've lasted this long.~
@2977 = ~I never pity the stupid and the weak, and they turned out to be both. Hells, my grandfather was pleased when he found out. The little half-elven freak had finally grown into a real Zhent. It just took a bit of pushing.~
@2978 = ~A choice, was it? I assure you, <CHARNAME>, they would have done the same to me eventually. Hells, my grandfather was pleased when he found out. The little half-elven freak had finally grown into a real Zhent. It just took a bit of pushing.~
@2979 = ~Ah. Then excuse my defensiveness.~
@2980 = ~They were thugs, <CHARNAME>. They were never going to be anything more than thugs. Hells, my grandfather was pleased when he found out. The little half-elven freak had finally grown into a real Zhent. It just took a bit of pushing.~
@2981 = ~Yes... that is unfortunate.~
@2982 = ~No? That's quite alright.~
@2983 = ~Ivanna... Ivanna Blackryn. Slightly over a decade ago now. My grandfather had had it arranged, and neither she nor I really had the option of refusing.~
@2984 = ~Would you have rather refused?~
@2985 = ~You didn't kill her, did you?~
@2986 = ~What was she like?~
@2987 = ~That's unfortunate.~
@2988 = ~No, I don't think so. I didn't care for her at first, but it was a very good match politically.~
@2989 = ~How so?~
@2990 = ~Is that all that mattered to you? Politics?~
@2991 = ~What happened to her?~
@2992 = ~...no, I didn't. Why does everybody always assume that? Whatever else you might want to say about me, I've never actually murdered my lovers.~
@2993 = ~Calm down, I didn't mean to offend.~
@2994 = ~I honestly wouldn't put anything past you.~
@2995 = ~Could you tell me what she was like?~
@2996 = ~What did happen to her?~
@2997 = ~As far as I can tell, she walked into one of the zones of wild magic that had sprung up across the city. Bane wasn't around at that point, so there wasn't a damn thing a cleric could do about it.~
@2998 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, I just... could you please not imply that you don't trust me?~
@2999 = ~I'm sorry. I really was just joking.~
@3000 = ~I do trust you, but you can't deny that the people you dislike tend to end up dead.~
@3001 = ~I trust who you are now, Adrian. The person you were ten years ago, however, seems more than a little bit unstable.~
@3002 = ~I might enjoy having you around, but I would sooner trust a snake.~
@3003 = ~Surprisingly docile for a Zhent noblewoman, but there was iron underneath. She loved her family... hells, she was even willing to marry me for them.~
@3004 = ~That doesn't seem like such a horrible fate.~
@3005 = ~That poor woman.~
@3006 = ~But would you have rather refused her?~
@3007 = ~It was fairly normal politics, but my thanks for the sentiment.~
@3008 = ~The Blackryns were one of the oldest families in the city... what they lacked in power, they made up in prestige. There had once been magic in the bloodline, but it had long since died out.~
@3009 = ~I appreciated the connections, they appreciated the fresh influx of magical blood... it was all very symbiotic.~
@3010 = ~How very romantic.~
@3011 = ~You should have picked someone with real power instead.~
@3012 = ~I guess I could never accuse you of not being opportunistic.~
@3013 = ~At the time? I was young, <CHARNAME>, and love was not something I'd ever been taught to value.~
@3014 = ~Do we need to talk about this?~
@3015 = ~At the time? Yes. What's the point of a political marriage that isn't politically sound?~
@3016 = ~She died. During the Time of Troubles. As far as I can tell, she walked into one of the zones of wild magic that had sprung up across the city. Bane wasn't around at that point, so there wasn't a damn thing a cleric could do about it.~
@3017 = ~It's... not the sort of thing I really care to think about, <CHARNAME>.~
@3018 = ~No... I suppose not.~
@3019 = ~No? I suppose it comes naturally, then.~
@3020 = ~I... see. Could we please not speak about her?~
@3021 = ~I didn't quite dislike her, <CHARNAME>. I may never have truly loved her, but... I suppose we were good for each other while it lasted. Could we please not speak about her?~
@3022 = ~I... alright, I suppose that's a fair point.~
@3023 = ~If there's one thing that my marriage to Ivanna did for me, I suppose it left me somewhat calmer, but... <CHARNAME>, could we please not speak about her?~
@3024 = ~I'm sorry to hear that.~
@3025 = ~Heh. I'm glad to hear it, <CHARNAME>.~
@3026 = ~Well, there are certainly worse ones.~
@3027 = ~(smile) You, my dear, walked into it with open eyes.~
@3028 = ~There are worse fates, <CHARNAME>.~
@3029 = ~I hope you weren't expecting poetry and rose petals.~
@3030 = ~...somehow I doubt that the high lord Manshoon would have accepted my suit.~
@3031 = ~Our Sembian protegy? I should have expected him to turn up sooner or later... it was sloppy to let him escape Sembia alive at all.~
@3032 = ~What happened between you two?~
@3033 = ~Who was he?~
@3034 = ~That was careless of you.~
@3035 = ~You don't need to make every problem disappear, you know.~
@3036 = ~He was a member of a merchant family in Selgaunt, and I... well, I let him court me for a time. Wizards may be as common as weeds in Sembia, but one who was already entrenched in a rival household... we can be valuable.~
@3037 = ~I was very good at playing the role of the disillusioned underling, and the fool was convinced he had me. He told me things he shouldn't have, and when he had nothing more of value to share... needless to say, keeping him around would have been dangerous.~
@3038 = ~So you set him up and got him thrown out of the country.~
@3039 = ~Wouldn't it have been easier to kill him?~
@3040 = ~How often did you play games like that?~
@3041 = ~You're lucky I didn't just let him have you.~
@3042 = ~I won't deny that.~
@3043 = ~Let's move on.~
@3044 = ~And yet you see what happens when I don't.~
@3045 = ~Gladly.~
@3046 = ~In the end, it was the simplest solution. He was from a powerful family... it was best to let them handle him.~
@3047 = ~And face the inevitable investigation? He was from a powerful family... it was best to let them handle him.~
@3048 = ~Often enough. Really, <CHARNAME>, intrigue is something of a sport in Sembia.~
@3049 = ~And you have my thanks for that.~
@3050 = ~Heh. I hope that's not a complaint.~
@3051 = ~Not about you, no. Just everything else.~
@3052 = ~Just an observation.~
@3053 = ~Well, you're not exactly prince charming, you know.~
@3054 = ~I... suppose I can appreciate the sentiment, <CHARNAME>. Just remember that it can always be worse.~
@3055 = ~My dear, you would have been bored by prince charming.~
@3056 = ~What? Oh, you mean by a Sunite or a Lathandrite or something along those lines? I suppose it never really occurred to me.~
@3057 = ~I can't say I've never considered it, but... perhaps that's a conversation that should wait until after this mess is over.~
@3058 = ~I honestly can't imagine what that must feel like. You know I'll do whatever I can to help you, but I really don't know where to start.~
@3059 = ~It doesn't really feel any different at all. I'm just not sure what will happen if I don't get it back.~
@3060 = ~I'm just afraid I'm going to lose control and kill someone. You, perhaps.~
@3061 = ~It hurts. It's like a mortal wound that no amount of divine magic can heal.~
@3062 = ~Well, I survived that horrible ritual. I'm sure I can hang on long enough to tear Irenicus apart and get it back.~
@3063 = ~Do you think I'll even have an afterlife if I die before I get it back?~
@3064 = ~I wish I could answer that question for you. I... I would guess that your ultimate fate is tied to Irenicus' now. Not the most pleasant of thoughts, I know.~
@3065 = ~How long do you think I have?~
@3066 = ~You're not going to run away from me, are you?~
@3067 = ~Have you really never heard of anything like this before?~
@3068 = ~If I can't get out of the way of your claws... hells, what a morbid topic. Still, I'm aware of the risks.~
@3069 = ~If you can't get out of my way? You're really not helping, you know.~
@3070 = ~I'm sorry. If I could do anything to lessen it... well, you know I would.~
@3071 = ~Is that all you have to say? You're really not helping, you know.~
@3072 = ~Good. And in the meantime... well, if you ever need anything.~
@3073 = ~I think that depends upon you, <CHARNAME>. You've as much willpower as anyone I've ever known, and as long as you cling to that, we can hope for the best.~
@3074 = ~I... I know. I'm sorry. There are some problems that talking helps to solve, and some... every second we waste is a small gift to Irenicus. We'll find him, <CHARNAME>. We have to.~
@3075 = ~...I've never been very good at running away before, <CHARNAME>. I'll be here to the bitter end... that much I can promise.~
@3076 = ~I've seen quite a few things, <CHARNAME> -- powerful men sometimes survived being possessed by gods during the Time of Troubles... but even that was somewhat different than this.~
@3077 = ~You've as much willpower as anyone I've ever known, and as long as you cling to that, we can hope for the best.~
@3078 = ~I... understand that. For what it's worth, she has a better chance than most people ever get.~
@3079 = ~I know. She has people coming after her, at least.~
@3080 = ~How can you even say that? She's trapped with a mad archmage!~
@3081 = ~She always was strong. Stronger than she seemed.~
@3082 = ~And you... I wouldn't bet against you, <CHARNAME>. Ever.~
@3083 = ~I know. I know that as well as anyone. But you... I wouldn't bet against you, <CHARNAME>. Ever.~
@3084 = ~I... certainly hope so. But dwelling upon it won't change anything. Let's just find her. And Irenicus.~
@3085 = ~I'm honestly more worried about you, but... she's strong, that one. She might not look like it, but then strength isn't always as black and white as it might seem.~
@3086 = ~I don't blame you. Are they... are you having nightmares about Irenicus? What he did to you?~
@3087 = ~More or less. They're pretty bad. What I remember of them, at least.~
@3088 = ~He used to offer me power, you know. In my dreams, he was there, as often as not, talking about my potential.~
@3089 = ~He offers me power, you know. In my dreams, he's there, as often as not, talking about my potential.~
@3090 = ~I have all types of nightmares. Irenicus features in some of them, but not all.~
@3091 = ~I shouldn't complain about this. Talking won't help.~
@3092 = ~I... can imagine. I was there too. Hells, the things I'd like to do to that man...~
@3093 = ~You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to, but if you do, I will listen.~
@3094 = ~I think that might help.~
@3095 = ~Well, I'd normally refuse, but I'd hate to disappoint you.~
@3096 = ~And risk waking your memories too? No, I'd rather not.~
@3097 = ~No, I really don't want to remember any more of it.~
@3098 = ~He... oh, I didn't know that. Is this a new thing?~
@3099 = ~New enough, yes. Ever since getting out of that dungeon, he's been in my head, trying to lure me in with these empty promises of unlocking my potential, as if I need his help to gain control over my own power.~
@3100 = ~New enough. He shows me terrible things... things I could do if I accepted Bhaal's legacy. I tell him I don't care, but he comes back. Over and over again.~
@3101 = ~No, it started after I left Candlekeep. A whispering voice in my dreams... dead Bhaal, demanding I submit, as if I gave a damn what some ghost wanted me to do with my own power.~
@3102 = ~No, it started after I left Candlekeep. Sinister voices in my dreams... my dead father, trying to win my submission, night after night...~
@3103 = ~I really don't want to talk about it.~
@3104 = ~He... oh, I didn't know that. Was this a new thing?~
@3105 = ~New enough, yes. Ever since we got out of that dungeon, he was in my head, trying to lure me in with empty promises of unlocking my potential... obviously, it worked.~
@3106 = ~New enough. He showed me terrible things... things I could do if I accepted Bhaal's legacy. I told him I didn't care, but he came back. Over and over again.~
@3107 = ~I really don't want to talk about this.~
@3108 = ~Let's just move on, then. Still, if you ever do want to...~
@3109 = ~Well. You know that I'm here.~
@3110 = ~All right. Come a bit closer, and you can tell me whatever you'd like.~
@3111 = ~I hope you're right, <CHARNAME>. I really do.~
@3112 = ~I'm sorry, that's... well, it doesn't even take an inconceivably powerful wizard to send messages through dreams, consensually or otherwise. That he'd be able to, even in the Cowled Wizards' hands... that doesn't bode well.~
@3113 = ~Still, it's just another type of torture, <CHARNAME>. Don't listen to him.~
@3114 = ~He had better still be in Spellhold when we get there.~
@3115 = ~I try not to. I just wish none of this had ever happened.~
@3116 = ~Wonderful. That just makes me worry about Imoen more.~
@3117 = ~I know that, Adrian. Let's stop talking about him now.~
@3118 = ~That's...what I was afraid of. I used to hear stories like that back home... mad Cyric haunting Banite priests' dreams, trying to force their submission before he lost patience and decided to kill the lot of them. That a dead god would do it too...~
@3119 = ~That's disturbing, and I can't help but wonder who the true force behind your dreams about Irenicus is... the wizard or your father.~
@3120 = ~As long as I keep on denying them, I don't think it makes much of a difference.~
@3121 = ~I've wondered about that often enough myself.~
@3122 = ~I know. I just wish none of this had ever happened.~
@3123 = ~Talking about this is just making it worse. Could we please just stop?~
@3124 = ~I'm sorry, that's... well, it doesn't even take an inconceivably powerful wizard to send messages through dreams, consensually or otherwise. Led along like cattle from the start...~
@3125 = ~Well, we've survived this long. I won't believe he's invincible.~
@3126 = ~Neither will I.~
@3127 = ~I just wish that none of this had ever happened.~
@3128 = ~He's seemed pretty damn invulnerable so far.~
@3129 = ~Let's stop talking about him now.~
@3130 = ~(sigh) Dwelling upon it won't change anything. Let's just find the bastard.~
@3131 = ~There's a difference between undefeated and invincible. Our damn wizard is going to have to learn that sooner of later.~
@3132 = ~Everything? Don't say that, <CHARNAME>. It's not all bad. Look at you. You've survived every challenge thrown at you. More than survived. You're practically a force of nature.~
@3133 = ~Don't wish all of this away. Please.~
@3134 = ~But is it worth all of the sacrifices? I don't think so.~
@3135 = ~Don't wish you away, you mean?~
@3136 = ~I don't. Not really. But if I can complain about it, I certainly intend to do so.~
@3137 = ~How can I not? I really don't want to talk about this.~
@3138 = ~In the end, I suppose it has to be.~
@3139 = ~Among other things, yes.~
@3140 = ~Heh. You're turning into me, my dear.~
@3141 = ~Let's just move on, then.~
@3142 = ~I feel like that too. I'm used to high stakes, but this...?~
@3143 = ~What if we lose?~
@3144 = ~Well, if you're falling apart, I just feel spectacular.~
@3145 = ~It'll be okay. It'll have to be okay.~
@3146 = ~You're supposed to dismiss my concerns, not agree with them!~
@3147 = ~Well, at least I'm not the only one worried.~
@3148 = ~We won't. To even think it is to court defeat. You're stronger than you think you are, <CHARNAME>. We'll win. We have to.~
@3149 = ~I'm...not. Not exactly. You're stronger than you think you are, <CHARNAME>. We'll win. We have to.~
@3150 = ~We win or we die, my dear? With those options, you're right. It'll be okay. You're stronger than you think you are.~
@3151 = ~I can't do both? We'll win, <CHARNAME>. We have to. You're stronger than you think you are.~
@3152 = ~No, you're not, but... we'll win, <CHARNAME>. We have to. You're stronger than you think you are.~
@3153 = ~I honestly don't know. Against a mage that powerful, I can't say I care for our chances, but... in Tymora's hands is not where I like to be, but in the end, I suppose we ultimately have no choice.~
@3154 = ~I doubt that's very reassuring.~
@3155 = ~No, it's not.~
@3156 = ~I did ask for the truth.~
@3157 = ~I have no quarrel with Tymora. She's always smiled upon me before.~
@3158 = ~And yet you stay.~
@3159 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@3160 = ~She's never been particularly fond of me, so hopefully your luck will be enough.~
@3161 = ~<CHARNAME>, my chances are abysmal no matter where I go. One way or the other, I'd rather be with you.~
@3162 = ~Funny, that it would be me hesitating. Let's wait just a bit longer, <CHARNAME>. Please.~
@3163 = ~Mmm. I'm sure the local Sunites and Sharessans could provide some... fascinating choices in attire. We'll talk about it tonight, my dear.~
@3164 = ~(Once you settle down for the night, Adrian draws you into his arms and begins to massage the tension out of your shoulders.)~
@3165 = ~(A moment before it might seem that this is all he has on his mind, you feel his lips brush against your ear.)~
@3166 = ~You haven't changed your mind, I assume?~

@3168 = ~I've never actually done this before.~
@3169 = ~I think I've waited long enough as it is.~
@3170 = ~You're not into anything weird, are you?~
@3171 = ~(turn around and kiss him)~
@3172 = ~I know I said I wanted this, but it's been a long <DAYNIGHT>.~
@3173 = ~(sigh) You're quite the tease, aren't you, <CHARNAME>? Well, if you'd rather we wait, I won't complain. Overly. Let's just go to sleep, then.~
@3174 = ~If it makes you feel better, I haven't done it in quite some time myself.~
@3175 = ~I'm not going to hurt you, <CHARNAME>. If you'd like to wait, I can accept that. And if you'd rather... hmm, build up to it, that's perfectly acceptable as well.~
@3176 = ~No, I'm ready. Just be careful.~
@3177 = ~I like that second option.~
@3178 = ~I'm not worried about me. You, however, had best perform.~
@3179 = ~I would rather wait.~
@3180 = ~Then we needn't wait any longer.~
@3181 = ~Nothing particularly so. You don't need to worry about it.~
@3182 = ~Interesting. I'll have to remember that. (kiss him)~
@3183 = ~On the contrary, I was very much hoping that the answer would be yes.~
@3184 = ~I'm not worried. I prefer a man who can take a bit of punishment.~
@3185 = ~I see. I know I said I wanted this, but it's been a long <DAYNIGHT>.~
@3186 = ~(He returns your kiss eagerly, his hands drifting downward to caress your body through your clothing.)~
@3187 = ~Ah. I suppose it has. Let's just go to sleep, then.~
@3188 = ~If you don't like anything, <CHARNAME>, just tell me.~
@3189 = ~(smile) I'll have to keep that in mind, then.~
@3190 = ~Whenever you're ready, just tell me.~
@3191 = ~What shall I do with you, my love? I try not to misuse magic, but this once...~
@3192 = ~...oh, I see. I suppose I'm at your mercy then, my dear.~
@3193 = ~Hmm? Oh, of course not.~
@3194 = ~Getting bored, are we?~
@3195 = ~As you wish, mistress.~
@3196 = ~I... see. I'm sorry to hear that.~
@3197 = ~I doubt it will be very flattering.~
@3198 = ~What do you think of Aerie?~

@3239 = ~I honestly don't know what you see in her, <CHARNAME>.~
@3240 = ~Every time he opens his mouth... well, I suppose I shouldn't finish that particular thought. I've never been fond of paladins, <CHARNAME>. Apparently their squires are even worse.~
@3241 = ~I think he's laughing at me half the time, but he's too damn placid to ever admit it.~
@3242 = ~The blackguard? Frankly, I try not to.~
@3243 = ~The Red Wizard? He's an idiot.~
@3244 = ~Remind me to never visit Sigil.~
@3245 = ~She knows what she's doing.~
@3246 = ~She's been through quite a bit, hasn't she? I'm surprised she's as sane as she is.~
@3247 = ~The Harper? Hells, isn't it obvious? At least she knows what she's doing, I suppose.~
@3248 = ~I'll never eat another turnip again.~
@3249 = ~I appreciate his skill, but I don't like the way he watches me.~
@3250 = ~I've worked with worse. At least he's competent.~
@3251 = ~I think I prefer the normal type of halflings.~
@3252 = ~He's a bit simple, isn't he? More than a bit, I suppose.~
@3253 = ~She's quite something, isn't she? Granted, I can't decide exactly what.~
@3254 = ~I'd like her better if she had the slightest idea what she was doing with that magic.~
@3255 = ~He's likely to get all of us killed.~
@3256 = ~I've never met someone so afraid of his own evil, evil shadow.~
@3257 = ~I wish she'd abandon the trappings of the Underdark entirely, but I suppose these things take time.~
@3258 = ~He's a clever one, isn't he?~
@3259 = ~I'm not sure how far I would trust him, but at least he knows what he's doing.~
@3260 = ~Are you sure we can't find another vampire coven that might want her?~
@3261 = ~Don't get me started.~
@3262 = ~We're not particularly close.~
@3263 = ~She's... not exactly what I would have expected.~
@3264 = ~He's not the sort of priest I'm accustomed to.~
@3265 = ~I wish he took things a bit more seriously sometimes.~
@3266 = ~I suppose we didn't really have much of a choice.~
@3267 = ~He's more entertaining than most elves.~
@3268 = ~I've never met a sorcerer so frightened by his own abilities.~
@3269 = ~She has wonderful taste in wine.~
@3270 = ~It's a wonder I haven't snapped and killed him yet.~
@3271 = ~I've been called an elitist bastard before, but that necromancer is beyond the pale. I wish he'd leave Toril and find himself another plane.~
@3272 = ~He's a bit much, isn't he? I suppose I appreciate that in a druid.~
@3273 = ~I don't care for soldiers, though he's more palatable than what I'm accustomed to. Granted, I doubt he'd find the comparison very flattering.~
@3274 = ~Heh. Talking to that one feels suspiciously like smashing my head against a wall. And yet I can't seem to help myself.~
@3275 = ~As long as she leaves me alone, I try not to.~
@3276 = ~I haven't decided whether to even take her seriously.~
@3277 = ~The blasted Cormyrian? I try not to.~
@3278 = ~She's slightly more tolerable than her husband.~
@3279 = ~I doubt I could stop you.~
@3280 = ~Do you have a favorite food?~
@3281 = ~What's your favorite color?~
@3282 = ~Do you have a least favorite color?~
@3283 = ~Who do you admire most in the world?~

@3290 = ~What's the worst thing you've ever done?~
@3291 = ~If you could be any animal, which would it be?~
@3292 = ~You don't use the common alphabet when you write. What language is that?~
@3293 = ~You're a half-elf. Ever considered a more musical career?~
@3294 = ~If you could go anywhere, where would you go?~
@3295 = ~Was that story you told Jan true?~
@3296 = ~The more exotic, the better.~
@3297 = ~I couldn't even tell you. Lords' parties, back home, tended to feature the most extravagant and exotic food imaginable. I don't even know what half of it was.~
@3298 = ~You'd eat well, at least, even if you stumbled into the wrong corner to your death before the night was over.~
@3299 = ~Silver and gold. Beyond that, I haven't really thought about it.~
@3300 = ~Purple, easily. That shade the Cormyrians like so much.~
@3301 = ~That's actually difficult to answer. I'm not particular fond of my former allies these days.~
@3302 = ~Fishing for compliments, are we?~
@3303 = ~Aside from you? No. Nor do I want it.~
@3304 = ~No. Nor do I want it.~
@3305 = ~So many possibilities, why settle on just one?~
@3306 = ~I was raised within the nobility, <CHARNAME>. Granted, it's not one of my better skills.~
@3307 = ~I hope you're not expecting a song of courtly love.~
@3308 = ~I'll be thirty-four in a couple of months.~
@3309 = ~It's not like we're running out of gold, <CHARNAME>.~
@3310 = ~Hells, <CHARNAME>, what sort of question is that? A crocodile seems as good a choice as any. Oh, the teeth on those things.~
@3311 = ~I try not to answer questions that could get me hanged, <CHARNAME>.~
@3312 = ~Hmm? Oh, those are Dethek runes. It's a more northeastern alphabet, partly dwarven in origin, if I recall. Old habit, I suppose.~
@3313 = ~Absolutely not.~
@3314 = ~Halruaa, I think. A fabled country where everyone practices wizardry... I think it would be worth a visit.~
@3315 = ~To live, however... probably Waterdeep.~
@3316 = ~About the Cult of the Dragon? No. Well, it was based on a story I'd heard and half remembered, but it never involved me.~
@3317 = ~I was a lord's grandson; I never had to face a suicidal initiation mission. Still, the mad gnome spits out so many of his own lies, he deserves a couple in return.~
@3318 = ~(Adrian glances at you.)~
@3319 = ~Dance with me.~
@3320 = ~(Watch him.)~
@3321 = ~(Take his hand.)~
@3322 = ~(Smile at him.)~
@3323 = ~(Pose for him.)~
@3324 = ~(Play with his hair.)~
@3325 = ~(Massage his shoulders.)~
@3326 = ~(Leave him alone.)~
@3327 = ~(Adrian glances at you, his expression relatively unguarded.)~
@3328 = ~Dance with me, Adrian.~
@3329 = ~(Touch his face.)~
@3330 = ~(Hug him.)~
@3331 = ~(Caress him.)~
@3332 = ~(Kiss him.)~
@3333 = ~I require your services in the Lust Chambers, jaluk.~
@3334 = ~In this pathetic little hovel? That bard can't carry a tune to save his life.~
@3335 = ~Your old Harper taught you how to dance, did he? I suppose that's not terribly surprising.~
@3336 = ~I'm a mage, <CHARNAME>, not an entertainer, and this doesn't qualify as a social event.~
@3337 = ~(There's a dangerous edge to Adrian's features to<DAYNIGHT>, and you can tell that he is likely to pick a fight at the slightest of provocations. It is unclear what exactly is bothering him, but you know by now that it could be anything or literally nothing at all.)~
@3338 = ~(You find him humming to himself, apparently unconsciously. The tune is foreign, noticeably so, and his voice is pure and clear -- perhaps a legacy of his elven heritage.)~
@3339 = ~(Adrian eventually catches you watching and falls silent. He doesn't say anything, but his eyes linger on you for a long moment afterwards.)~
@3340 = ~(You glance at Adrian and find him playing with his own hair, tugging at it angrily as if he isn't used to wearing it this long. It occurs to you that he probably isn't: people have gone to far greater lengths than this to avoid being recognized, and Adrian has as much need of such strategies as anyone.)~
@3341 = ~(You glance at Adrian and find him already watching you, his gaze thoughtful and perhaps slightly appreciative. His eyes slip away as soon as he realizes that you have noticed, but he neither blushes nor looks uncomfortable. A slight smile may curve his upper lip, but it is hard to tell for certain.)~
@3342 = ~(Despite being a practitioner of innate magic, Adrian is as obsessed with texts as any wizard, and to<DAYNIGHT> you find him engrossed in the study of a scroll. He barely avoids stumbling once or twice, but continues on in his reading, undeterred.)~
@3343 = ~(You turn to find Adrian staring at you, his expression clouded and vaguely angry. He seems about to snarl something unpleasant at you, but at the last minute, turns to pick a fight with someone else instead.)~
@3344 = ~(Adrian is perched nearby, casually chewing on an apple. His attention, however, is focused on you, and there's a glint in his eyes that isn't quite professional. As soon as he realizes that you're watching him, however, he tosses the apple onto the ground and busies himself in another task.)~
@3345 = ~(You find Adrian walking close beside you - far more so than is usual for him. Lost in thought, he doesn't seem to notice the proximity until his arm brushes against yours. He comes to himself with a start and quickly moves away from you.)~
@3346 = ~(Adrian slips away from your grasp, pretending not to notice.)~
@3347 = ~(Adrian watches you thoughtfully as you grab his hand, but he doesn't try to stop you. His skin is slightly warm to the touch and you notice that his pulse is perhaps a touch quicker than it should be. With a reluctant sigh, the half-elf finally pulls his hand away.)~
@3348 = ~(Adrian twists his hand free and glowers at you. Despite the forbidding look, there is a strange note in his expression - part fear, part longing, part something indescribable - that almost says more than the glare.)~
@3349 = ~(For a mage, Adrian's hand is surprisingly calloused, and as his sleeve falls away, you notice the slight silver scars that wrap around his wrists: testament to his own time spent in captivity. He frowns but doesn't comment.)~
@3350 = ~(It's a moment before Adrian even notices that your fingers are entwined in his own. He freezes for an instant, uncertain, before pulling away.)~
@3351 = ~(Adrian folds his arms as soon as you try to grab his hand. He doesn't meet your eye for a long time afterwards.)~
@3352 = ~(As you reach out to grab his hand, you find it slick and darkened by some spell component. He raises an eyebrow at you as if challenging you to take his hand anyway.)~
@3353 = ~I need that for spellcasting, <CHARNAME>.~
@3354 = ~(While Adrian doesn't quite smile back, the sullen scowl that had previously been decorating his face drops away, and he shakes his head, bemused.)~
@3355 = ~What do I look like, <CHARNAME>, a portrait artist? Save it for someone who cares.~
@3356 = ~(You've seldom quite seen Adrian blush before, but a slight tinge of color reddens his cheeks as he notices your smile.)~
@3357 = ~(The half-elf sighs as he notices your attention, and a small but sincere smile dances briefly across his lips.)~
@3358 = ~(Slowly, slightly reluctantly, Adrian smiles back.)~
@3359 = ~You needn't smile at me like a common barmaid, my dear.~
@3360 = ~(His eyes bright with too much wine, Adrian grins back at you, the expression less predatory than you might have expected.)~
@3361 = ~(Adrian smothers a yawn behind his hand before tossing a sleepy smile back at you.)~
@3362 = ~(Adrian quickly busies himself with some other task, but you can sense that his attention remains fixed on you.)~
@3363 = ~(He raises an eyebrow at you, not even bothering to pretend to look away.)~
@3364 = ~Playing the seductress, my lady?~
@3365 = ~Lovely as always, <CHARNAME>.~
@3366 = ~(Flushing slightly, Adrian quickly turns away.)~
@3367 = ~I'm no painter, my lady.~
@3368 = ~(Adrian chews on his lip nervously, though he seems incapable of tearing his gaze away from you.)~
@3369 = ~(Adrian watches you with a slight smile on his face, and more than once you feel his eyes returning to you throughout the rest of the hour.)~
@3370 = ~(As the group stops to rest for a few minutes, you find yourself walking over to where Adrian is sitting, engrossed in the study of a book you took off of a mage. You take advantage of his distraction to run your fingers through a portion of his black hair.)~
@3371 = ~(Almost surprisingly, he seems to enjoy the attention, and he leans back against your leg as you begin to casually weave the strands together. When he speaks, however, his voice is gently mocking.)~
@3372 = ~Shall I braid yours next, my lady?~
@3373 = ~(Adrian is usually fastidious about his appearance, but you notice to<DAYNIGHT> that his hair is in complete disarray, as if he can't be bothered to fix it. You reach out to untangle some of the knots, but Adrian angrily slaps your hand away.)~
@3374 = ~(As you reach out to play with Adrian's hair, he skitters away, slightly nervously. He stays away from you for the next hour, and though you can feel his eyes on you from time to time afterwards, when you turn to address him, he is always looking away.)~
@3375 = ~I don't think so, <CHARNAME>.~
@3376 = ~(A quick break has stretched into a longer one, and you find your mage a short distance away, half asleep, his hair in disarray. As you reach out to fix it for him, he mumbles something in Damaran but doesn't push you away.)~
@3377 = ~Take another step and you'll lose that hand, my dear.~
@3378 = ~(He jerks in surprise as your fingers close around his hair, and you accidentally pull it. Adrian yelps in pain, and his eyes follow you accusingly for the rest of the hour.)~
@3379 = ~I'm beginning to think that I should invest in a hat.~
@3380 = ~No thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@3381 = ~(As soon as you call a halt, Adrian settles unceremoniously on the ground, drags off one of his boots, and angrily fishes a stone out of it. He freezes as your hands land on his shoulders, but slowly relaxes as you massage the tension away.)~
@3382 = ~Mm, you're quite good at that, <CHARNAME>. Ever considered giving up on adventuring and joining a harem instead? I dare say we could get a fine price for you, my lady.~
@3383 = ~(The half-elf murmurs softly with pleasure as you begin to massage the knots out of his muscles. He doesn't pull away for a long moment.)~
@3384 = ~(Adrian bats your hands away.)~
@3385 = ~Don't we have places to be and people to kill, my lady?~
@3386 = ~(Adrian frowns at you as if he thinks you might just bite him.)~
@3387 = ~I think I'll survive without it, <CHARNAME>.~
@3388 = ~(The music to<DAYNIGHT> is dreadful, but Adrian relents to your request with a helpless shrug. You attempt to dance for a few moments before he loses patience entirely and draws you into a corner instead. He presses you gently against a wall, eager to distract himself from the terrible music.)~
@3389 = ~(He smiles at the request, clearly enjoying to<DAYNIGHT>'s entertainment despite himself, and lets you pull him away from his table and onto the floor. He holds you somewhat closer than is appropriate, clearly paying more attention to you than to the steps, and in his distraction, barely keeps from tripping over himself.)~
@3390 = ~(Adrian sneers a bit at the request, gesturing dismissively at the already crowded floor, before drawing you into his arms instead. His lips brushing against your ear, he begins to whisper demeaning comments about the various dancers on the floor as he works his hands beneath your clothing.)~
@3391 = ~(Your half-elven lover is in a poor mood to<DAYNIGHT>, his eyes downcast and his jaw set angrily. You've learned by now to steer clear of him when he is in tempers such as this, but he notices your regard all the same. He flashes you a quick, weak smile before focusing his attention elsewhere.)~
@3392 = ~(Adrian is perched nearby, casually chewing on an apple. His attention, however, is focused on you, and there's a glint in his eyes that isn't remotely professional.)~
@3393 = ~(Adrian seems to be in good spirits to<DAYNIGHT>, and he walks with the easy, practiced gait of someone who is certain of his place in the world, perhaps even believes the world would crumble and burn without his presence. He glances up at you, a smile gracing his face.)~
@3394 = ~(You turn to look at Adrian and find him already studying you. Shrugging casually at having been found out, he walks closer to you and wraps an arm around your waist.)~
@3395 = ~(Adrian eventually catches you watching and falls silent, shrugging slightly.)~
@3396 = ~(Adrian catches you watching and doesn't have the courtesy to look away. His gaze meet yours, and there's a distinctive gleam of challenge in his eyes. You stare at each other for a long moment, and the contest would seem meaningful if it weren't so childish. He finally laughs, slightly wildly, shattering your concentration.)~
@3397 = ~(When you look at him again, he's thoughtfully examining a tear in his sleeve as if the bizarre competition never happened at all.)~
@3398 = ~(Adrian is notedly distracted to<DAYNIGHT>, his attention likely hundreds of miles away. Lost in thought, he barely avoids tripping over his own feet, and he blushes slightly once he realizes that you saw.)~
@3399 = ~(Adrian drops his arm over your shoulder instead, drawing you closer.)~
@3400 = ~Hand holding, my dear? What are we, peasants?~
@3401 = ~(He smiles at you and takes your hand in return, gently massaging your wrist.)~
@3402 = ~(Adrian catches your hand loosely as you reach for him, and he tugs it closer to his face, not quite sharply enough to unbalance you.)~
@3403 = ~Shall I kiss it like a southern princeling or a lord from Waterdeep, my lady? Well, I suppose the courtesies must be observed, empty or otherwise.~
@3404 = ~(For a mage, Adrian's hand is surprisingly calloused, and as his sleeve falls away, you notice the slight silver scars that wrap around his wrists: testament to his own time spent in captivity. He smiles weakly but doesn't pull away.)~
@3405 = ~I need that for spellcasting, my dear.~
@3406 = ~(Adrian smiles at you as you reach for his hand. It's several moments before he finally draws away.)~
@3407 = ~You do enjoy public displays, don't you?~
@3408 = ~(The half-elf sighs softly, a small but sincere smile dancing briefly across his lips.)~
@3409 = ~My dear, you really are absolutely exquisite.~
@3410 = ~(His eyes bright with too much wine, Adrian grins back at you, the expression slightly manic.)~
@3411 = ~(Adrian raises an eyebrow at you, his eyes dancing.)~
@3412 = ~No games, please, my dear.~
@3413 = ~Playing the seductress again, my lady? Be careful what you ask for.~
@3414 = ~(Adrian is openly enjoying the display, his eyes traveling across your body and his thoughts quite obviously less than pure.)~
@3415 = ~(He smiles at you halfheartedly, clearly not in the mood to<DAYNIGHT>.)~
@3416 = ~(He interprets your attention as invitation, closing the distance between you and taking you into his arms.)~
@3417 = ~(When you stop to rest for a few moments, you half pull Adrian into your lap, running your fingers through his hair. He hisses briefly, relaxing only when he feels your fingers against his scalp.)~
@3418 = ~Having fun there, my dear?~
@3419 = ~Tangle it up, <CHARNAME>, and I may just have to cut it all off.~
@3420 = ~(He pulls away from you, somewhat moodily, biting down on his lip as if he's physically keeping himself from making an unpleasant comment.)~
@3421 = ~(As the group stops to rest for a few minutes, you find yourself walking over to where Adrian is sitting, engrossed in the study of a book you took off of a mage.)~
@3422 = ~(You take advantage of his distraction to run your fingers through a portion of his black hair. He seems to enjoy the attention, and he leans back against your leg as you begin to casually weave the strands together.)~
@3423 = ~(A quick break has stretched into a longer one, and you find Adrian a short distance away, half asleep, his hair in disarray. As you reach out to fix it for him, he mumbles something in Damaran but doesn't push you away.)~
@3424 = ~(Adrian is usually fastidious about his appearance, but you notice to<DAYNIGHT> that his hair is in complete disarray, as if he can't be bothered to fix it. He grudgingly allows you to reach out to untangle some of the knots.)~
@3425 = ~(He draws you closer as you stroke his face, gently massaging the small of your back.)~
@3426 = ~(For a brief moment, you feel his smile against your palm, and then he drags your hands away, holding them loosely at your sides as he kisses you.)~
@3427 = ~(He pushes your hand away, shaking his head in mild annoyance, before returning his attention to his bottle of mead.)~
@3428 = ~(A few moments later, he comes up beside you, pressing his lips against the side of your throat in unspoken apology.)~
@3429 = ~(Smiling, he takes your hands and presses them briefly against his lips.)~
@3430 = ~You shouldn't let me distract you so, my dear. We have things to do.~
@3431 = ~Yes, I know. There's only so much time even a half-elf can go without shaving.~
@3432 = ~(He glances at you quizzically for a moment before laughing and brushing your hand away.)~
@3433 = ~(Adrian tenses up when you hug him, and several heartbeats pass before he brings his own arms up to awkwardly hold you in return.)~
@3434 = ~Could we not do this in public, <CHARNAME>?~
@3435 = ~I've never understood this custom. It seems perfectly suited to stabbing somebody in the back. Literally.~
@3436 = ~(Adrian has to force himself to relax when you embrace him.)~
@3437 = ~(He hisses at you softly, struggling halfheartedly to get away.)~
@3438 = ~(Adrian jumps when you suddenly embrace him from behind, and the words of defensive spell die on his lips. He reaches out, awkwardly patting your arm.)~
@3439 = ~(Sighing softly, he rests his hands awkwardly on your waist.)~
@3440 = ~<CHARNAME>, stop it. Please.~
@3441 = ~(Adrian shrugs his shoulders luxuriously beneath your hands, and it is unclear whether he's enjoying the massage or your presence more.)~
@3442 = ~(As you call a short break, you move over to Adrian, resting your hands on his shoulders to give him one of the massages he so enjoys. He slips free and pulls you into his lap instead, kneading his fingers into your own shoulders.)~
@3443 = ~Mmm, you're quite good at that, <CHARNAME>. Ever considered giving up on adventuring and joining a harem instead, my lady? Though I dare say I'd rather keep you for myself.~
@3444 = ~(The half-elf murmurs softly with pleasure as you massage the knots out of his muscles.)~
@3445 = ~Don't we have places to be and people to kill, my dear?~
@3446 = ~(As soon as you call a halt, Adrian settles unceremoniously on the ground, drags off one of his boots, and angrily fishes a stone out of it. He jumps slightly when your hands land on his shoulders, but slowly relaxes as you massage the tension away.)~
@3447 = ~Mmm, one of the advantages of simply wearing robes.~
@3448 = ~Yes, yes. I already know that I'm tense.~
@3449 = ~(He smiles, loosening his robes enough that you can slip your hands beneath.)~
@3450 = ~(He shuts his eyes for a moment, indulging in the attention.)~
@3451 = ~(He draws you closer and kisses you, clearly enjoying the shameless indulgence.)~
@3452 = ~(He catches your hands, pressing them to his lips for a brief moment before pushing you away with a wry smile.)~
@3453 = ~(Smiling, he catches you by the shoulders and turns you around, holding you close as his own hands roam across your body.)~
@3454 = ~Turnabout, my dear?~
@3455 = ~Mmm, even for me, this is... somewhat exhibitionistic. Could we indulge later, my lady?~
@3456 = ~You shouldn't let me distract you so, my love. We have things to do.~
@3457 = ~(He holds you close as you kiss him, finally pulling away with a reluctant smile.)~
@3458 = ~(His hands travel slowly up the front of your body as you kiss, his fingers brushing lightly against the undersides of your breasts before he withdraws them and pulls away.)~
@3459 = ~Best not to get too carried away, my dear.~
@3460 = ~Mmm, if you're hoping to turn me into a fair prince with this... mmm. Never mind.~
@3461 = ~(He's reading through a tome when you approach him, and shakes his head when he realizes your intent, clearly not interested at the moment.)~
@3462 = ~(He shuts his eyes and holds you close, shamelessly indulging in the attention.)~
@3463 = ~Careful, my lady. I don't think we have the time to properly indulge right now.~
@3464 = ~(The kiss is all too short, and he shakes his head afterwards, indicating that this is neither the time nor the place.)~
@3465 = ~(He quirks an eyebrow briefly, but you know him well enough to sense the intrigue lurking beneath his annoyance.)~
@3466 = ~...as you command, jabress.~
@3467 = ~...I'm sure you do, jabress.~
@3468 = ~I obviously live to serve, jabress.~
@3469 = ~(Adrian is somewhat more comfortable in his new skin than he perhaps should be, and you notice that almost every reflective surface grabs his attention. He catches you watching and tosses a self-satisfied smile at you.)~
@3470 = ~We're entitled to our vanity, jabress.~
@3471 = ~Do you like what you see, Malla Veldrin? Well, how could you not?~
@3472 = ~(He likely won't admit it, but you can tell from the angry set of Adrian's jaw that he is not enjoying his role as a male drow.)~
@3473 = ~(You catch his eye, and his lips twitch into a slight, short-lived smile. He turns away quickly, clearly uncomfortable showing any affection in this environment.)~
@3474 = ~Did you require something, jabress?~
@3475 = ~(Adrian smiles in return, the gesture markedly arrogant on his dark elven face.)~
@3476 = ~(His eyes linger on your very revealing drow clothing for far longer than what would normally be appropriate. Shaking his head helplessly, he finally turns away.)~
@3477 = ~(He smiles slightly, but his eyes are vaguely troubled as he watches you. You get the distinct impression that he misses your true from.)~
@3478 = ~(He raises an eyebrow at you as if challenging you to do more than simply tease.)~
@3479 = ~(Adrian leans against you submissively, his smile somewhat wry, as you run your hands across his body.)~
@3480 = ~How may I please you to<DAYNIGHT>, jabress?~
@3481 = ~(He sighs with pleasure, clearly appreciating the attention.)~
@3482 = ~You treat me too well sometimes, mistress.~
@3483 = ~(sigh) At least I needn't worry about any other female attempting to lay claim to me, Veldrin.~
@3484 = ~(Adrian submits to your kiss with only a touch of resistance, and he makes no complaint when you push him aside afterward.)~
@3485 = ~(He presses his body against yours, indulging in the kiss as he attempts to remain at least visibly submissive.)~
@3486 = ~(Adrian tenses slightly when you kiss him, and moves away as soon as you release him. He glances at you briefly, and it is obvious that he isn't enjoying these roles to<DAYNIGHT>.)~
